[![PyPiVersion](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/comparisonframe)](https://pypi.org/project/comparisonframe/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kiril-Mordan/reusables)](https://github.com/Kiril-Mordan/reusables/blob/main/LICENSE)

Comparison Frame is designed to automate and streamline the 
process of comparing textual data, particularly focusing on various 
metrics such as character and word count, punctuation usage, and 
semantic similarity.
It's particularly useful for scenarios where consistent text analysis is required,
such as evaluating the performance of natural language processing models, 
monitoring content quality, or tracking changes in textual data over 
time using manual evaluation.


## Installation

```bash
pip install comparisonframe
```
