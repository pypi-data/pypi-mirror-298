        This variable exercises an edge cases in :func:`beartype.beartype`.
        Previously, :func:`beartype.beartype` erroneously conflated class
        variables whose values are types with nested classes by decorating the
        former as if they were the latter. In the best case, doing so decorated
        external classes *not* intended to be decorated; in the worst case,
        doing so provoked infinite recursion.

        This variable exercises that worst case. Notably:

        * :class:`enum.Enum` subclasses as follows:

          #. *All* :class:`enum.Enum` subclasses define a private
             ``_member_type_`` attribute whose value is the :class:`object`
             superclass, which :func:`beartype.beartype` then decorated.
          #. However, the :class:`object` superclass defines the ``__class__``
             dunder attribute whose value is the :class:`type` superclass, which
             :func:`beartype.beartype` then decorated.
          #. However, the :class:`type` superclass defines the ``__base__``
             dunder attribute whose value is the :class:`object` superclass,
             which :func:`beartype.beartype` then decorated.
