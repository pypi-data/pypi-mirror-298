Skyalmanac is a **Python 3** script that creates the daily pages of the Nautical Almanac (based on the UT timescale).
The generated tables are needed for celestial navigation with a sextant.
Although you are strongly advised to purchase the official Nautical Almanac, this program will reproduce the tables with no warranty or guarantee of accuracy.

**NOTE:** The *original* Skyalmanac that was a hybrid version using both Skyfield and Ephem has been abolished and replaced with the Skyfield version. It is now the same as the SFalmanac version (except for the new name). There is no justification for the hybrid version any more.

Skyalmanac-Py3 can now employ multiprocessing (if your processor has multiple cores) reducing the processing time. Single-processing is also available as an option if required.
Testing has been successfully performed on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (No testing done on Mac OS.) Compared to single-processing, data processing (excluding conversion from TEX to PDF)

* ... of a 6-day Nautical Almanac is **4x faster** on Windows 10; **2x faster** on Linux.
* ... of 6-day Event Time Tables is almost **5x faster** on Windows 10; **3x faster** on Linux.

Windows 10 uses up to 8 threads; Linux uses up to 12 threads in parallel. Testing was performed on a PC with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core (16 threads) Processor. Windows & Mac OS spawn new processes; Linux forks new processes (the code is compatible with both techniques and will also run on CPUs with fewer cores/threads).

Quick Overview
--------------

This is the **PyPI edition** of `Skyalmanac-Py3 <https://github.com/aendie/Skyalmanac-Py3>`_ (a Changelog can be viewed here). Version numbering follows the scheme *Major.Minor.Patch*, whereby the *Patch* number represents some small correction to the intended release.

| **NOTE:** Version numbering in PyPI restarted from 1.0 as the previous well-tested versions that exist since early 2019 were never published as PyPI packages.

The astronomical library employed is: `Skyfield <https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/>`_.

Skyalmanac uses the Hipparcos catalog as its star database. If a current version of Skyfield (>= 1.31) is used, you have two options (which one, you specify by manually editing *config.py*):

* if "useIERS = False", the built-in UT1 tables in the installed version of Skyfield will be employed.
* if "useIERS = True", for optimal accuracy (specifically for all GHA data), Earth orientation data from IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service) is downloaded and then used until it 'expires'. It expires after a chosen number of days (also specifiable in *config.py*). Note that IERS specifies the range of Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) data from 2nd January 1973 and is updated weekly. Refer to the `IERS web site <https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home_node.html>`_ for current information.

Software Requirements
=====================

|
| Nearly all of the astronomical computation is done by the Skyfield library.
| Typesetting is done typically by MiKTeX or TeX Live.
| Here are the requirements/recommendations:

* `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ >= 3.4 (the latest version is recommended)
* `skyfield <https://pypi.org/project/skyfield/>`__ >= v1.48 (the latest is recommended; see the `Skyfield Changelog <https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/installation.html#changelog>`_)
* `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ < 2.0.0 (only for Skyfield versions < 1.48)
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ >= 1.0 (to decode the Hipparcos star catalog)
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ >= 2.2.2 (if numpy version >= 2.0.0)
* `MiKTeX <https://miktex.org/>`_ |nbsp| |nbsp| or |nbsp| |nbsp| `TeX Live <http://www.tug.org/texlive/>`_

Installation
============

Install a TeX/LaTeX program on your operating system so that ``pdflatex`` is available.

Ensure that the `pip Python installer tool <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/>`_ is installed.
You may check that the latest version of SFalmanac is installed::

  python -m pip uninstall skyalmanac
  python -m pip install skyalmanac

Installing Skyalmanac ensures that Skyfield and Pandas (and their dependencies) are also installed. If previous versions of Skyalmanac were installed, consider upgrading Skyfield and Pandas thus::

  python -m pip install --upgrade skyfield pandas

Thereafter run it with::

  python -m skyalmanac

On a POSIX system (Linux or Mac OS), use ``python3`` instead of ``python`` in the commands above.

This PyPI edition also supports installing and running in a `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ virtual environment.

Finally check or change the settings in *config.py*.
Its location is printed immediately whenever Skyalmanac runs.

Guidelines for Linux & Mac OS
-----------------------------

Quote from `Chris Johnson <https://stackoverflow.com/users/763269/chris-johnson>`_:

It's best to not use the system-provided Python directly. Leave that one alone since the OS can change it in undesired ways.

The best practice is to configure your own Python version(s) and manage them on a per-project basis using ``venv`` (for Python 3). This eliminates all dependency on the system-provided Python version, and also isolates each project from other projects on the machine.

Each project can have a different Python point version if needed, and gets its own ``site_packages`` directory so pip-installed libraries can also have different versions by project. This approach is a major problem-avoider.
