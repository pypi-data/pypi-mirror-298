## Installation

```

## Usage

Currently, fastforge supports the following command:

```

This command creates a new directory with the given `APP_NAME` and populates it with the following empty files:

- `__init__.py`
- `router.py`
- `schemas.py`
- `models.py`
- `dependencies.py`
- `config.py`
- `constants.py`
- `exceptions.py`
- `service.py`
- `utils.py`

## Project Philosophy

fastforge aims to provide a simple, non-over-engineered solution for developers to quickly set up a FastAPI project with a predefined folder structure. It's designed to give you a solid starting point without unnecessary complexity, allowing you to focus on building your application logic.
