# Relationship Counting Software Package

## Module 1 : RelationsClass

### Class Name ：Relation

The `Relation` class is used to define a relation between elements. It takes two parameters in its constructor: `elements` and `relations`.

### Parameters

- `elements` (list, optional): A list of elements. If not provided, an empty list is created.
- `relations` (list of tuples, optional): A list of pairs of elements representing the relations between them. If not provided, an empty list is created.

### Description

The `elements` parameter is converted to a list if it is present; otherwise, an empty list is created. The `relations` parameter is a list containing pairs of elements representing the relations between them. When traversing the `relations` list, if an element in a pair does not exist in the `elements` list, it is added to the `elements` list. Then, the `add_relation` method is called to add the relation of the pair of elements, and this pair is added to the `relations_list` list. Finally, the `set_relation_matrix` method is called to set the relation matrix.

### Class Name ：RelationDefineByInt

#####  Variables: Decimal number n; number of set elements size

The `RelationDefineByInt` class is a subclass of the `Relation` class, designed for handling specific situations where relations are defined through integers. It takes two parameters in its constructor: `n` and `size`.

### Parameters

- `n` (int): An integer representing the binary representation of the relationship.
- `size` (int): Represents the size of the relationship matrix.

### Description

In the constructor, the integer `n` is first converted to a binary string, which is then padded to the square of `size` length with '0'. This binary string is then converted into a list of integers, which is reshaped into a `size` by `size` matrix. Finally, the constructor of the superclass is called to initialize the relationship with this matrix.

For example, if we have an integer 13 (binary representation is 1101), and we want to represent this relationship in a 2x2 matrix, we can do this:

```python
relation = RelationDefineByInt(13, 2)
```

This will create a relationship matrix as follows:

```python
[[1 1]
 [0 1]]
```
