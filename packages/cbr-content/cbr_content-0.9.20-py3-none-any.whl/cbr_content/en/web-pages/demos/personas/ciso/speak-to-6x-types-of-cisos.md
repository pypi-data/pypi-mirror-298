## Speak with 6x types of CISOs 

Here is an example of sending the same query to 7 different Chat Bots UIs,each with a 
different system prompt:

- experienced and confident
- experienced but with no confidence
- experienced but highly jaded and sarcastic with cyber security

- What is your approach to handling a major security breach?
- How do you stay updated with the latest cybersecurity trends and threats?
- What advice would you give to a company just starting to build its cybersecurity program?

but you can change these values for all chatbot UIs using these select boxes:
