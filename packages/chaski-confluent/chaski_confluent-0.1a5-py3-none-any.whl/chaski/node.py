ChaskiNode: Distributed Node Communication and Management
=========================================================

This module defines the `ChaskiNode` class and its associated classes for managing network communication
between distributed nodes. It provides a framework for creating Nodes which can connect to each other
over TCP/IP, handle messaging and serialization of data, and perform network-wide functions, such as
discovery and pairing of nodes based on shared subscriptions.

Classes
=======
    - *MessagesPool*: Manages a collection of messages with a fixed maximum size, ensuring thread safety.
    - *Edge*: Represents a connection to a peer in the network, managing the input/output streams and storing
      metadata such as latency, jitter, and subscription topics.
    - *Message*: A container class for messages, packing together the command, data, and timestamp information.
    - *UDPProtocol*: An asyncio protocol class for handling UDP packets, interfacing with the asyncio Datagram Protocol.
    - *ChaskiNode*: The main class representing a node in the network, which can initiate connections, handle incoming
      requests, and orchestrate network-wide actions.

        This method is used to propagate messages received by a node to other connected

        This helps in disseminating the message across the network while preventing
        immediate looping of the message back to its origin.

        Parameters
        ----------
        message : Message
            The message to be propagated. This contains the command, topic, data,

            The edge from which the message was originally received. This edge will
            be excluded from the propagation to prevent looping.

        -----
        - The message's TTL (Time-to-Live) will be decremented by one. If the TTL

        Request an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).

        This coroutine initiates a request for an SSL certificate from the specified
        Certificate Authority (CA) address. It generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR),
        sends it to the CA, and waits for the CA to sign the CSR and return the signed certificate.
        Additionally, it retrieves the CA's certificate and updates the node's SSL context.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ca_address : str

        -----
        The method performs the following steps:
        1. Generates a CSR locally.
        2. Establishes a connection with the CA node.
        3. Sends the CSR to the CA for signing.
        4. Receives the signed certificate and CA's certificate from the CA.
        5. Writes the signed certificate and CA's certificate to disk.
        6. Updates the SSL context of the node with the new certificate.
