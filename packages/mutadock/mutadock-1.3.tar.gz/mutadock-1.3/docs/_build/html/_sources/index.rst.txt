Overview
--------

MUTADOCK is a comprehensive library designed for mutation studies and
multiple receptor-ligand docking. It provides tools and methods to
analyze and predict the effects of mutations on receptor-ligand
interactions, enabling researchers to study protein function and drug
binding affinity in a detailed manner.

Features
--------

-  Mutation Studies: Analyze the impact of various mutations on protein
   structure and function.
-  Multiple Receptor-Ligand Docking: Perform docking simulations
   involving multiple receptor and ligand combinations.
-  User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use commands and functions for quick
   analysis and simulations.

Installation
------------

To install MUTADOCK, follow these steps:

1. Install using pip

::

   pip install mutadock

1. Clone the repository:

::

   git clone https://github.com/naisarg14/mutadock.git

Navigate to the project directory:

::

   cd MUTADOCK

3. Install dependencies including Pyrosetta:
