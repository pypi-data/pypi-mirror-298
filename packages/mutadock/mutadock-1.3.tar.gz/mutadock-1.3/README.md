# MUTADOCK

## Overview
MUTADOCK is a comprehensive library designed for mutation studies and multiple receptor-ligand docking. It provides tools and methods to analyze and predict the effects of mutations on receptor-ligand interactions, enabling researchers to study protein function and drug binding affinity in a detailed manner.

## Features
- Mutation Studies: Analyze the impact of various mutations on protein structure and function.
- Multiple Receptor-Ligand Docking: Perform docking simulations involving multiple receptor and ligand combinations.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use commands and functions for quick analysis and simulations.

## Installation
To install MUTADOCK, follow these steps:

1. Install using pip
```
pip install mutadock
```

### OR

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/naisarg14/mutadock.git
```


Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd MUTADOCK
```


2. Install dependencies including Pyrosetta:

- For Linux:
```
./install.sh
```

- For Windows:
```
win_install.bat
```


2. Install dependencies without PyRosetta (PyRosetta is required and should be installed seperately):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
Here's a brief guide to using MUTADOCK:
