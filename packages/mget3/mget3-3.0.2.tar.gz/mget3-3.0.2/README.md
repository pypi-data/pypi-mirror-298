# Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET)

<img src="https://github.com/jjrob/MGET/blob/main/doc/GeoEco/static/MGET_Logo.png?raw=true" align="right"/>

**MGET**, also known as the **GeoEco** Python library, helps researchers
access, manipulate, and analyze ecological and oceanographic data. MGET can be
accessed through the GeoEco Python API or an associated ArcGIS geoprocessing
toolbox.

MGET was developed by the Duke University [Marine Geospatial Ecology
Lab](https://mgel.env.duke.edu/).

## Installation

MGET requires 64-bit Python 3.9–3.12 running on Windows or Linux. For full
functionality, ArcGIS Pro 3.2.2 or later or ArcGIS Server 11.2 or later is
also required, along with some freely-available software. MGET can be
installed with `pip install mget3`, but please see these platform-specific
instructions to ensure all prerequisites are met.

> [!NOTE] 
> We are still in the process of porting MGET for Python 2.7 and ArcGIS
> Desktop to work with Python 3.x and ArcGIS Pro and Server. Not everything
> has been ported yet. If you have questions about something that is missing,
> please post a question to the [discussion
> forum](https://github.com/jjrob/MGET/discussions).

## Citation

MGET was originally documented by the following paper. Although much of the
underlying software architecture has changed since 2010, the overall concept
remains, of using Python to integrate useful code implemented in several
languages and to expose it as an ArcGIS geoprocessing toolbox. If you find
MGET is useful in your work, please cite this paper in your publication. If
you are unable to access the paper, please email jason.roberts@duke.edu for a
