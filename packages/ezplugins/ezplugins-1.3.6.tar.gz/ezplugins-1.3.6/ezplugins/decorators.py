    Decorate a class as being a loadable plugin.

    Classes can be decorated like this::

        import ezplugins

        @ezplugins.ezplugin
        class MyPlugin:
            ...

    The result of using this decorator is the class is marked as being a :class:`~ezplugins.plugin.EZPlugin` plugin class that is
    instantiated during plugin load.

    Multiple plugin classes can be defined in the same file. The search for plugin classes is recursive.

    The only restriction relating to plugins is that the plugin package must be a valid Python package.

    Internal plugin names are set to the path of the module it is loaded from within the ``PYTHONPATH`` and suffixed with
    ``#ClassName``, in this case it would be ``package.path#MyPlugin``. This can be used to call a specific plugin. On a side note,
    to make things easier, plugins can also be called using ``#ClassName``, keep in mind though that one can have two classes with
    the same name in different modules.

    See the :func:`~ezplugin_metadata` decorator for specifying a plugin alias.

    Decorate a class as being a loadable plugin with metadata. See :func:`~ezplugin` for more information.

    Classes can be decorated and additional metadata added like this::

        import ezplugins

        @ezplugins.ezplugin_metadata(alias="CoolPlugin")
        class MyPlugin:

    Parameters
    ----------
    alias : :class:`str` | None
        Plugin class alias, used when one wants to call a specific plugin or set of plugins with a custom name.
        This makes it easy to specify a plugin name instead of using the fully qualified plugin name or class name. You can also
        specify the same alias for a number of plugins which will result in all of them being called when using that alias.

def ezplugin_method(*, order: int = 5000) -> Callable[[EZPT], EZPT]:
    """
    Decorate a class method as a runnable plugin method and to provide it with an optional ``order`` or execution.

    Plugin methods must be decorated, this allows EZPlugins to know that this method can be called. The result of using this
    decorator is the method will get additional attributes set which EZPlugins looks for when determining which methods can be run
    or not.

    An example of using this decorator can be found below::

        import ezplugins

        @ezplugins.ezplugin
        class MyPlugin:

            ...

            # Methods must be decorated in order to be called

            def some_method(self, param1, param2):
                return f"{param1=}, {param2=}"

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : :class:`int`
        Run order of method if multiple methods are being executed. Defaults to 5000. Methods are executed lowest to highest.
