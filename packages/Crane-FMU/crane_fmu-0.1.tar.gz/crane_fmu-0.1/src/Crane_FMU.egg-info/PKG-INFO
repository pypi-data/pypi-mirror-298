Introduction
============
The package extends the `component_model` package to provide the means to construct cranes.
The package can be used to define concrete cranes and simulate their usage, see `tests/resources/mobile-crane.py` as example.

Getting Started
---------------
A concrete crane model should consist of an extension of the Crane object, 

* defining general model variables like `name`, `author`, `version`, etc.
* defining the anticipated set of booms
* if there is a wish to keep parameters configurable, these can be kept as parameters of the extended model.
* In a separate script, instantiate the concrete crane, test it and run `Model.build(...)` to make the FMU.

See the file `tests/resources/mobile_crane.py` and related test files 
as an example on how a concrete crane can be defined and used.


1.	Install the `crane_fmu` package: ``pip install crane_fmu``
2.	Software dependencies: `PythonFMU`, `component_model`, `numpy`, `pint`, `uuid`, `ElementTree`
3.	Latest releases: Version 0.1, based on component_model version 0.1

Usage example
-------------
This is a simple mobile crane, like they are used on e.g. building sites with 

* a short pedestal, which can be turn around, 
* one boom with variable length and which can be lifted
* one rope, where loads can be attached.
