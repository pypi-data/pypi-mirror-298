New features
============
There is no new feature in this version, only bug fixes and internal
implementation changes.

Implementation
==============
- throw a TypeError if a Javascript function is called with keyword arguments
- to fix bugs in conversion between JS and Python, all internal lists must now
  have __class__ set
- add methods to js_array to avoid handling JS arrays in py_list.js
- fix __class_getitem__ on builtin types
- rewrite and simplify code for indexedDB cache. Related to issue #2488
- define compiler flags in brython_builtins.js, use them in libs/dis.js and in
  ast_to_js.js
- reduce size of generated Javascript by putting more features in
  make_function_infos(), make_async() and enter_frame()
- improve speed of open() on Chrome
