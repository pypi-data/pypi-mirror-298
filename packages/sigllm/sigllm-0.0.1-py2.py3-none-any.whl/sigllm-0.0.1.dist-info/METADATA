# Overview

TODO: Provide a short overview of the project here.

# Install

## Requirements

**sigllm** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
is highly recommended in order to avoid interfering with other software installed in the system
in which **sigllm** is run.

These are the minimum commands needed to create a virtualenv using python3.8 for **sigllm**:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p $(which python3.6) sigllm-venv
```

Afterwards, you have to execute this command to activate the virtualenv:

```bash
source sigllm-venv/bin/activate
```

Remember to execute it every time you start a new console to work on **sigllm**!

<!-- Uncomment this section after releasing the package to PyPI for installation instructions
## Install from PyPI

After creating the virtualenv and activating it, we recommend using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) in order to install **sigllm**:

```bash
pip install sigllm
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
-->

## Install from source

With your virtualenv activated, you can clone the repository and install it from
source by running `make install` on the `stable` branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sintel-dev/sigllm.git
cd sigllm
git checkout stable
make install
```

## Install for Development

If you want to contribute to the project, a few more steps are required to make the project ready
for development.

Please head to the [Contributing Guide](https://sintel-dev.github.io/sigllm/contributing.html#get-started)
for more details about this process.

# Quickstart

In this short tutorial we will guide you through a series of steps that will help you
getting started with **sigllm**.

TODO: Create a step by step guide here.

# What's next?

For more details about **sigllm** and all its possibilities
and features, please check the [documentation site](
