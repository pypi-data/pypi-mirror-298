# sopel-rainbow

A Sopel plugin to make things RAINBOW COLORED.

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-rainbow
```

## Configuring

The easiest way to configure `sopel-rainbow` is via Sopel's configuration
wizardâ€”simply run `sopel-plugins configure rainbow` and enter the values for
which it prompts you.

### `order` setting

By default, `sopel-rainbow` outputs colors in the "standard" rainbow `order`,
ROYGBIV, subject to receiving clients' use of the customary meanings for IRC
color codes 0-15. If set explicitly in your Sopel config file, this default
value would look like:

```ini
[rainbow]
order =
    4
    7
    8
    3
    12
    2
    6
```

If you want to get creative (or cater to a community with shared color norms
that differ from the "de facto" values established by mIRC and friends)
override the `order` with your own list of _numeric_ codes:

```ini
[rainbow]
order = # Americans and French can fight over this one
    4
    0
    2
```

### `random_start` setting

Starting the rainbow at the beginning of the `order` every time is also
default behavior. If you want the rainbow to start at a random place every
time instead, set the Boolean option `random_start` to `yes` or `on`:

```ini
[rainbow]
random_start = on
```

## Dependencies

* Sopel version 7.1 or higher
* Python 3.8 or higher

Sopel 7.x should still run on Python 2.7 or older Python 3 releases, but it's
not maintained any more; and neither is this plugin tested on anything older.

## Changelog

The brief, illustrious history of `sopel-rainbow`, a silly little plugin
spawned from [a tongue-in-cheek
upstream issue](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/issues/1962).


### sopel-rainbow 0.2.0

Changed:

* Dropped support for Sopel<7.1 + Python<3.8
  * `sopel.module` -> `sopel.plugin`
  * Removed shim around `sopel.formatting.plain()` function
  * Updated `__future__` imports
  * Removed UTF-8 coding comment

Added:

* Use `unicodedata2` if it's installed

Fixed:

* `random_start` setting (broken by changes in [#1][])
* Errors in `sopel-plugins configure rainbow`
  * Wrong setting name (`rainbow` -> `order`)
  * Wrong default value type (`list[int]` -> `list[str]`)

Meta:

* Reorganized to match current Sopel standard (mainly putting "the
  actual plugin" in a `plugin.py` file, not `__init__.py`)
* Updated packaging to use `pyproject.toml` metadata
* Added release automation using PyPI Trusted Publishing
