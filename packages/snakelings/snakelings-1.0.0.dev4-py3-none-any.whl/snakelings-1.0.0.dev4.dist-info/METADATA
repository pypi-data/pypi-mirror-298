## The problem.
Learning Python involves **actually** doing things practically; sitting down and watching YouTube tutorial after another won't get you anywhere. Beginners tend to fall into this, we even have a name for it, Tutorial üî• Hell. Tutorials are good for getting to know the basics but that's where I believe you should stop, and begin actually writing code.

üêç Snakelings helps with üåü that. üêç Snakelings provides a set of short exercises to immerse you into developing and debugging Python code. Inspired by [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), each exercise in Snakelings has intentional faults designed to expose you to as many Python exceptions and errors as possible. üêç Snakelings bridges the gap between the theoretical and practical coding knowledge by providing a **real** environment.

## TODO
Todo has been moved over here --> https://github.com/THEGOLDENPRO/snakelings/issues/10
