class CmdStreamA:
    '''Abstract base class of all command streams.
    A command stream process a series of commands.
    Each command is a tuple of command and result.
    Not all results must be real results.
    
    Different streams specializations can have 
    different pre and postconditions on streams.
    The precondition is what properties a stream must
    exhibit to be processible by the stream instance.
    Postconditions describe the stream after the 
    stream instance.
    Stream properties are described by
    - ordered: is the sequence of commands ordered such 
    that all dependencies are resolved, i.e. are 
    all elements created before used. 
    - resName: are res names assigned to cmds 
    - res: are results assigned to cmds
    - refByHis: His is used in cmds
    - refByObj: Obj is used in cmds

    stream pre and postconditions must
    match when connecting streams.

    The typical usage of a stream is 
    Begin()
    ... do something with the stream ...
    Flush()
    
    Multiple streams can be connected by calling
    Connect(next stream instance).
    Connected stream instance invove each other 
    in the connect order with the commands passing 
    by. The order of commands and calling time 
    can however be varied by some streams, like 
    dependency sorting streams.
