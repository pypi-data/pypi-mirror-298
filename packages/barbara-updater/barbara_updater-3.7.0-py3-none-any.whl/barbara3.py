# 9/26/24 problems from concurrency with obs buttons, not worth it. looking to replace
# 9/25b/24 4 new reg_sat views work, no zoom or full screen while working. still hangup after random, then bobs button
# 9/25/24 working on obs site choice hang up, and adding reg sat choices. reg sat choice page is updated
# 9/13c/24 fixed distortion on lcl radar, lightning, station plots
# 9/13b/24 working on distorted selenium images - fix for 3 obs and random obs
# 9/13a/24 working on dangerous clean up code
# 9/13/24 added code to not allow choice of malfunctioning radar site
# 9/5/24 added set position of scraped frame in national radar to prevent dead ends
# 9/4a/24 working to fix error while trying to make station models. This will be 3.6.8 
# 9/4/24 working to fix connection aborted error will be ver3.6.7
# this 9/2b/24 will be renamed 9/2c/24 on all other devices and will be ver 3.6.6
# 9/2b/24 changing this version (on bubba's old device) from other 9/2b/24 versions
# 9/2/24 Selenium set up correctly, a and b obs sites buttons working again
# 8/29/24 also programmatically install pytz and certifi this will be version 3.6.4 - not working on mine
# 8/28/24 testing to successfully import folium v3.6.3
# as of 8/23/24 this is the latest version (8/21/24) that's working w/o overlapping, but concerns about folium install
# 8/21A/24 change local radar queue function to avoid dead ends
# then had to install folium programmatically, correctly. ver 3.6.2
# ver 3.6.0 with maps for land sites, back buttons and stored user choices on page choose
# 8/21/24 Ver 3.6.0 brief delay message when random sites chosen & improved greeting message
# 8/20B/24 prevent display of back button on page choose when xs length > 0
# 8/20B/24 previous choices stored from page choose for reference and reuse

# 8/18C will add map to show 3 random sites. 18D eliminates blank delay
# 8/18B all 3 working with map, flash before the map fixed - took out update idletasks
# 8/18A has first two stations working, often with a flash before map is displayed. 18B will work to get all 3
# 8/18/24 some a variables deleted (pg 138) will add new map and technique to bobs on 18A
# 8/17A/24 replace5nearby aobs check land working great. 17B will add color coding - giving up for now
# 8/17/24 replace5nearby layout set. Map not redrawn upon each site choice on 8/17A
# 8/12A/24 replace5nearby layout very close to goal. Buttons slow response
# 8/12/24 replace5nearby includes the new techniques for aobs_check_land
# 8/12/24 Have to change sounding functions back because of problems with 'img_label_sounding'
# 8/12/24 is 3.5.2 back to old error catching for radiosonde, calling next function or hide upon an error
# 8/10/24 will be 3.5.1 - only call hide functions to prevent overlapping images
# 8/10/24 working on double imaging with new ideas from pages 134-135 only call next function once

# 8/9/24 VERSION 3.5.0 random sites and buttons for sites. Check for functional buoys in def check_buoy
# 8/6B/24 brought in option to random choose 3 sites - confusion with variables:
