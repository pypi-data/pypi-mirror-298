# ReLing: Command-line Tool for Learning Foreign Languages

ReLing allows you to learn or enhance your knowledge of any [major world language](#languages) supported by [GPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). To use this tool, you must have a paid [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) with an [API key created](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

The program operates as follows:

- [Select a GPT model](#setting-models-and-api-key) to generate a [text](#generating-texts) or [dialogue](#generating-dialogues) on a chosen or random topic.
- View or translate the generated content into any [supported language](#languages).
- Take an  [exam](#taking-exams) to translate the text from one language to another and receive:
  - A score for each sentence on a 10-point scale;
  - Suggestions for improving your translations;
  - The program’s own translation of the sentence.

You can retake exams at your preferred frequency until you achieve perfect scores.

ReLing also enables you to view a [list](#listing-content) of all generated texts and dialogues and their associated [exam histories](#exam-history).

Optionally, the system can vocalize sentences in both the source and target languages and accept your responses via voice.

## Installation<a id="installation"></a>

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.12 or higher and [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/), then proceed based on your audio preference:

### Without Audio Support

```bash
pipx install reling
```

### With Audio Support

On macOS, first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then:

```bash
brew install portaudio
```

On Ubuntu, run:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
```

Install the package with the `audio` extra:

```bash
pipx install "reling[audio]"
```

### Finalizing Setup

You may need to restart your terminal for the `reling` command to be recognized.

Additionally, to enable command-line completions, execute:

```bash
reling --install-completion
```

For Mac users, you may also need to append `compinit -D` to the end of your `~/.zshrc` file.


## Generating Texts<a id="generating-texts"></a>
`reling create text`

The command format is:

```bash
reling create text en [--level basic] [--topic food] [--style news] [--size 5] [--include "cook: a person"] [--model <GPT-MODEL>] [--api-key <OPENAI-KEY>]
```

### Language

Specify a [supported language](#languages) as the only positional argument. The text will be in that language but can be translated later.

### `level`

Choose from three complexity levels:

- `basic`;
- `intermediate` (default);
- `advanced`.

### `topic`

You may select a topic for the text. If unspecified, a random topic from [100 predefined options](src/reling/data/topics.csv) will be chosen.

### `style`

You may also choose a style for the text. If unspecified, a random style from [25 predefined options](src/reling/data/styles.csv) will be chosen.

### `size`

This sets the number of sentences in the text. By default, 10 sentences are generated.

### `include`

This parameter allows you to ensure the inclusion of specific vocabulary in the text. You can specify a simple word (`--include cook`), a word with a specific meaning (`--include "cook: a person"`), or several words or phrases (`--include "cook: a person" --include soup --include "mac and cheese"`).

### `model` & `api-key`

Refer to [Setting Models and API Key](#setting-models-and-api-key).

```

### Language

Specify a [supported language](#languages) as the only positional argument. The dialogue will be generated in this language and can be translated later.

### `level`

Choose from three complexity levels:

- `basic`;
- `intermediate` (default);
- `advanced`.

### `speaker`

Specify an interlocutor or let the system choose randomly from [20 predefined options](src/reling/data/speakers.csv).

### `topic`

Choose a topic for the dialogue or let it be automatically determined.

### `size`

This parameter sets the number of sentence pairs in the dialogue. The default is 10.

### `include`

You can specify a simple word (`--include cook`), a word with a specific meaning (`--include "cook: a person"`), or several words or phrases (`--include "cook: a person" --include soup --include "mac and cheese"`).

### `speaker-gender` & `user-gender`

Refer to [Specifying Genders](#specifying-genders).

If the interlocutor’s gender is not specified, it will be randomly chosen as either `male` or `female`.

```


## Automatic Content ID<a id="automatic-content-id"></a>

If a dot (`.`) is provided in place of a content ID in any command, the system will assume that you are referring to the last text or dialogue you interacted with.


## Languages<a id="languages"></a>

ReLing supports over **180 major languages** [sourced from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) under the [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).

To specify a language in a command argument, you can either write its full name (e.g., `English` or `english`) or use the 2-character or 3-character code for that language (e.g., `en` or `eng` for English).


## Setting Models and API Key<a id="setting-models-and-api-key"></a>

To avoid specifying [model names](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) and entering the [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) separately for each command, you can set the following environment variables:

- `RELING_API_KEY`: a pre-generated API key for OpenAI’s web API.
- `RELING_MODEL`: the name of the GPT model used for generating text and taking exams (e.g., `gpt-4o`).
- `RELING_TTS_MODEL`: the name of the text-to-speech (TTS) model (e.g., `tts-1`). Since current OpenAI TTS models primarily focus on English and may not perform well in other languages, you can use the additional model `_gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech) for better voice output in other languages (note the leading underscore).
- `RELING_ASR_MODEL`: the name of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for voice response recognition (e.g., `whisper-1`).

Parameter values specified in individual commands will take precedence over these environment variables.

If a model or key is not specified in either the command or the environment variable, the program will prompt you to enter it directly.


## Specifying Genders<a id="specifying-genders"></a>

The system requires knowledge of your gender and the gender of your interlocutor to accurately generate dialogues in languages with grammatical gender and to provide voice outputs with appropriate voices.

To avoid specifying your gender each time you generate a new dialogue, you can set the environment variable `RELING_USER_GENDER`.

The system accepts one of the following values for gender: `male`, `female`, or `nonbinary`.
