# Ignoring the interior surfaces of a mesh while generating a point cloud in Blender
# using a script can be a bit more complex. The goal is to ensure that points are only
# generated on the external surfaces of the mesh. Here are some steps you can take in
# your script to achieve this:
#
# Analyze Normals: Blender's mesh data structure includes normals for each face.
# Normals are vectors perpendicular to the face's surface. For an enclosed mesh, the
# normals of the external faces generally point outwards, while the normals of internal
# faces point towards the interior. You can use this property to distinguish between
# external and internal faces.
#
# Select External Faces Only: Modify your script to consider only those faces whose
# normals point outwards. This might involve calculating the average normal direction
# or using other geometric properties of the mesh.
#
# Point Generation on External Faces: Once you've identified the external faces, you can
# proceed to generate points on these faces as you did in the previous script.
