## Algorithm Overview

LyCORIS currently contains LoRA (LoCon), LoHa, LoKr, (IA)^3, DyLoRA, Native fine-tuning (aka dreambooth).
GLoRA and GLoKr are coming soon.
Please check [List of Implemented Algorithms](docs/Algo-List.md) and [Guidelines](docs/Guidelines.md) for more details.

A simple comparison of some of these methods are provided below (to be taken with a grain of salt)

|                       | Full | LoRA | LoHa | LoKr low factor | LoKr high factor $^+$ |

[> means better and smaller size is better]

$^+$ Usually we take `factor <= 0.5 * sqrt(dim)` as low factor and `factor >= sqrt(dim` as high factor. For example, factor<=8 for SD1.x/SD2.x/SDXL can be seen as low factor, and, factor>=16 can be seen as high factor. <br>
$^*$ Flexibility means anything related to generating images not similar to those in the training set, and combination of multiple concepts, whether they are trained together or not <br>
$^†$ It may become more difficult to switch base model or combine multiple concepts in this situation <br>

**The actual performance may vary depending on the datasets, tasks, and hyperparameters used. It is recommended to experiment with different settings to achieve optimal results.**

## Usage

### Image Generation

#### [a1111/sd-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

After sd-webui 1.5.0, LyCORIS models are officially supported by the built-in LoRA system. You can put them in either `models/Lora` or `models/LyCORIS` and use the default syntax `<lora:filename:multiplier>` to trigger it.

When we add new model types, we will always make sure they can be used with the newest version of sd-webui.

As for sd-webui with version < 1.5.0 or sd-webui-forge, please check this [extension](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/a1111-sd-webui-lycoris).

#### Others

As far as we are aware, LyCORIS models are also supported in the following interfaces / online generation services (please help us complete the list!)

- [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI)
- [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/)
- [Tensor.Art](https://tensor.art/)

However, newer model types may not always be supported. If you encounter this issue, consider requesting the developers of the corresponding interface or website to include support for the new type.

### Training

There are three different ways to train LyCORIS models.

- With [kohya-ss/sd-scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts) (see a list of compatible graphical interfaces and colabs at the end of the section)
- With [Naifu-Diffusion](https://github.com/Mikubill/naifu)
- With your own script by using LyCORIS as standalone wrappers for **ANY** pytorch modules.

In any case, please install this package in the corresponding virtual environment. You can either install it

- through pip

  ```bash
  pip install lycoris-lora
  ```
- or from source

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS
  cd LyCORIS
  pip install .
  ```

A detailed description of the network arguments is provided in [docs/Network-Args.md](docs/Network-Args.md).

#### kohya script

You can use this package's kohya module to run kohya's training script to train lycoris module for SD models

- with command line arguments

  ```bash
  accelerate launch train_network.py \
    --network_module lycoris.kohya \
    --network_dim "DIM_FOR_LINEAR" --network_alpha "ALPHA_FOR_LINEAR"\
    --network_args "conv_dim=DIM_FOR_CONV" "conv_alpha=ALPHA_FOR_CONV" \
    "dropout=DROPOUT_RATE" "algo=locon" \
  ```
- with `toml` files

  ```bash
  accelerate launch train_network.py \
    --config_file example_configs/training_configs/kohya/loha_config.toml \
    --dataset_config example_configs/training_configs/kohya/dataset_config.toml
  ```

  For your convenience, some example `toml` files for kohya LyCORIS training are provided in [example/training_configs/kohya](example_configs/training_configs/kohya).

#### HCP-Diffusion

**The support for HCP-Diffusion has been dropped on LyCORIS3.0.0, we will wait until HCP side finish the implementation of new wrapper**

You can use this package's hcp module to run HCP-Diffusion's training script to train lycoris module for SD models

```bash
accelerate launch -m hcpdiff.train_ac_single \
  --cfg example_configs/training_configs/hcp/hcp_diag_oft.yaml
```

For your convenience, some example `yaml` files for HCP LyCORIS training are provided in [example/training_configs/hcp](example_configs/training_configs/hcp).

For the moment being the outputs of HCP-Diffusion are not directly compatible with a1111/sdwebui.
You can perform conversion with [tools/batch_hcp_convert.py](tools/batch_hcp_convert.py).

In the case of pivotal tuning, [tools/batch_bundle_convert.py](tools/batch_bundle_convert.py) can be further used to convert to and from bundle formats.
Check [docs/Conversion-scripts.md](docs/Conversion-scripts.md) for more information.

#### As standalone wrappers

See [standalone_example.py](standalone_example.py) for full example.

Import `create_lycoris` and `LycorisNetwork` from `lycoris` library, put your preset to `LycorisNetwork` and then use `create_lycoris` to create LyCORIS module for your pytorch module.

For example:

```py
from lycoris import create_lycoris, LycorisNetwork

LycorisNetwork.apply_preset(
    {"target_name": [".*attn.*"]}
)
lycoris_net = create_lycoris(
    your_model, 
    1.0, 
    linear_dim=16, 
    linear_alpha=2.0, 
    algo="lokr"
)
lycoris_net.apply_to()

# after apply_to(), your_model() will run with LyCORIS net
lycoris_param = lycoris_net.parameters()
forward_with_lyco = your_model(x)
```

You can check my [HakuPhi](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/HakuPhi) project to see how I utilize LyCORIS to finetune the Phi-1.5 models.

#### Other method

After LyCORIS3.0.0, Parametrize API and Functional API have been added, which provide more different ways on utilizing LyCORIS library.

Check API reference for more informations.
You can also take the [test suites](test/) as a kind of examples.

#### Bitsandbytes support

See [bnb_example.py](bnb_example.py) for example. Basically as same as standalone wrapper.

#### Graphical interfaces and Colabs (via kohya trainer)

You can also train LyCORIS with the following graphical interfaces

* [bmaltais/kohya_ss](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss)
* [derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts](https://github.com/derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts)
* [Akegarasu/lora-scripts](https://github.com/Akegarasu/lora-scripts)

and colabs (please help us complete the list!)

* [hollowstrawberry/kohya-colab](https://github.com/hollowstrawberry/kohya-colab)
* [Linaqruf/kohya-trainer](https://github.com/Linaqruf/kohya-trainer)

However, they are not guaranteed to be up-to-date. In particular, newer types may not be supported. Consider requesting the developers for support or simply use the original kohya script in this case.

## Change Log

For full log, please see [Change.md](Change.md)

### 2024/06/29 update to 3.0.0 - Brand New Functional API, Parametrize API and Module API

#### The reasons of 3.0.0

We reconstruct the whole library with new Class definition and brand new Functional API system.

We also removed lot of redundant/unused modules.

Since the whole library are changed significantly. We decide to call it 3.0.0 as a new major version.

#### Major Changes

* New Module API
* Add Parametrize API
* Add Functional API
  * LoCon/LoHa/LoKr/Diag-OFT/BOFT only.
* Remove optional deps from install_requires
* Remove lot of redundant/deprecated modules
* Better testing
* HunYuan DiT Support ([PR](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1378) in kohya-ss/sd-scripts)

#### Full change log

##### New Features

* LyCORIS now have consistent API for different algorithm like `bypass_forward_diff` or `get_diff_weight` method. Developers of other project can utilize these API to do more tricks or integrate LyCORIS into their framework more easily.
* LyCORIS now have parametrize API which utilize `torch.nn.utils.parametrize.register_parametrization` to directly patch individual parameters. Which can be useful for MHA layer or other tricky modules.
  * Currently only support 2~5D tensors. And LyCORIS will pretend these weights are weight of Linear/Conv1,2,3D then send it into LyCORIS modules
  * More native implementation or more detailed control will be added in the future.
* LyCORIS now have functional API. Developers who prefer functional more than Module things can utilize this feature.
  * Functional API also allow developers who don't want to introduce new dependencies. Just copy-paste the source code and utilizing it. (with Apache-2 License, directly copy-paste is totally allowed)
* Add support for Conv1d and Conv3d module on LoCon/LoHa/LoKr/Full/OFT/BOFT/GLoRA (not All algo in LyCORIS support them, you may receive error when apply unsopported algo), support inherited module (for example: `LoRACompatibleConv` or `LoRACompatibleLinear` from [`huggingface/diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/lora.py))
* HunYuan DiT support.

##### Improvements, Fixes, Slight Changes

* Drop dependencies related to kohya-ss/sd-scripts:
  * We now take kohya-ss/sd-scripts as optional dependency
  * Which means `transformers`, `diffusers` and anything related to kohya are all optional deps now.
* The definition of dropout and rank_dropout in each algorithm are changed. Since some concept of original rank_dropout in the lora of kohya-ss/sd-script is hard to applied to other algorithm. We can only design the dropout for each module seperatedly.
* `apply_max_norm` issue are all fixed.
* DyLoRA, (IA)^3, GLoRA are all rewritten and support Linear/Conv1,2,3d.
* (IA)^3, GLoRA, Diag-OFT, BOFT are supported in `create_lycoris_from_weights`
  * `lycoris.kohya.create_network_from_weights` also support them as well.
* Fix wrong implementation of BOFT.
* `create_lycoris_from_weights` and `create_network_from_weights` now have correct logging infos.
* `get_module` and `make_module` are moved into modules' API.

## Todo list
