        // 1. Screen only supports `OSC 11` (background) and not `OSC 10` (foreground)

        // 2. Screen replies to queries in the incorrect order.
        //    We send  `OSC 11` + `DA1` and expect the answers to also be in that order.

        //    and so we get the `DA1` response back *first*. This is usually an indicator that
        //    the terminal doesn't support the `OSC` query.

        //
        //    * Don't send `DA1`, just `OSC 11`. \

        //      => we hit the 1s timeout :/
        //
        //    * Send the query (`OSC 11` + `DA1`) to the underlying terminal by wrapping it between `CSI P` and `ST`.
        //      (There's a reverted commit that does exactly this: f06206b53d2499e95627ef29e5e35278209725db)
