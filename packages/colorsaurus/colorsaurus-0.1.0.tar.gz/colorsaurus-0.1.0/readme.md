[![Crate Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/terminal-colorsaurus)](https://crates.io/crates/terminal-colorsaurus)


Determines the background and foreground color of the terminal
using the `OSC 10` and `OSC 11` escape codes.

This library helps answer the question *Â«Is this terminal dark or light?Â»*.

Windows is unfortunately [not supported](./doc/windows.md).

## Example
```rust,no_run
use terminal_colorsaurus::{color_scheme, QueryOptions, ColorScheme};

match color_scheme(QueryOptions::default()).unwrap() {
    ColorScheme::Dark => { /* ... */ },
    ColorScheme::Light => { /* ... */ },
}
```

## Inspiration
This crate borrows ideas from many other projects. This list is by no means exhaustive.

* [xterm-query]: Use `mio` to wait for the terminal's response with a timeout.
* [termbg]: Lists a lot of terminals which served as a good starting point for me to test terminals as well.
* [macOS doesn't like polling /dev/tty][macos-dev-tty] by Nathan Craddock
* [This excellent answer on Stack Overflow][perceived-lightness] for determining the perceived lightness of a color.
* [This comment in the Terminal WG](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/8#note_151381) for the `DA1` trick
  to easily detect terminals that don't support querying the colors with `OSC 10` / `OSC 11`.
