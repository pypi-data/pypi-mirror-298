Based on the updated implementation of your loading tool, here's an enhanced README file that includes details about the CustomLoading class and its usage, along with examples and explanations about the decorator function for adding loading animations to other functions.

# enimation

**enimation** is a customizable loading tool for Python projects that allows users to implement various loading animations with extensive customization options. This package enhances user experience during data processing, API calls, or any time-consuming tasks by providing visual feedback.

## Features

- **Customizable Loading Animations**: Choose from multiple loading animations, or define your own.
- **Duration Control**: Specify the update interval for the loading animation.
- **Decorator Support**: Easily add loading animations to any function with a simple decorator.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install enimation

Or if you are developing locally, you can install it in editable mode:

pip install -e .

Basic Usage

To get started with the loading tool, follow these simple steps:

1. Import the CustomLoading Class

First, import the CustomLoading class from the package:

from enimation import CustomLoading

2. Create an Instance of CustomLoading

Create an instance of the CustomLoading class, optionally providing a custom animation function and interval:

loader = CustomLoading(interval=0.1)  # 0.1 seconds update interval

3. Start the Loading Animation

Call the start() method to begin the loading animation in a separate thread:

loader.start()

4. Stop the Loading Animation

When the task is completed, call the stop() method to stop the animation:

loader.stop()

Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using CustomLoading:

import time
from enimation import CustomLoading

def long_running_task():
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running task

loader = CustomLoading()
loader.start()
long_running_task()
loader.stop()

Advanced Usage

Custom Animations

You can create your own custom loading animations by defining a function that updates the loading display. For example:

def my_custom_animation():
    frames = ['ðŸŒŸ', 'âœ¨', 'ðŸŒˆ', 'ðŸ’«']
    while not loader.stop_event.is_set():
        for frame in frames:
            print(f'\rLoading {frame}', end='', flush=True)
            time.sleep(0.5)

loader = CustomLoading(animation_function=my_custom_animation, interval=0.5)
loader.start()
long_running_task()
loader.stop()

Using the Loading Decorator

The loading decorator can be used to automatically add loading animations to your functions. Here's how to use it:

from enimation import loading

@loading()  # Use default loading animation
def long_running_task():
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running task

long_running_task()

Customizing the Decorator

You can also pass a custom CustomLoading instance to the decorator:

custom_loader = CustomLoading(animation_function=my_custom_animation)

@loading(custom_loading_instance=custom_loader)
def another_long_running_task():
    time.sleep(10)  # Simulate another long-running task

another_long_running_task()

Integration with Asynchronous Tasks

You can run the loading animation in a separate thread alongside your main tasks. For example:

import threading

def long_running_task():
    time.sleep(10)

loader = CustomLoading()
threading.Thread(target=long_running_task).start()
loader.start()
loader.stop()
