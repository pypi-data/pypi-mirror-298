"""

--------------------

This module contains the classes that appear as instances in the Game Engine. A
script must interact with these classes if it is to affect the behaviour of
objects in a game.

The following example would move an object (i.e. an instance of
~bge.types.KX_GameObject) one unit up.

```
# bge.types.SCA_PythonController
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

# bge.types.KX_GameObject
obj = cont.owner
obj.worldPosition.z += 1
```

To run the code, it could be placed in a Blender text block and executed with
a ~bge.types.SCA_PythonController logic brick.

    This class must contain a dictionary of properties: `args` and two default functions: `start` and `update`.The script must have .py extension.The component properties are loaded from the `args` attribute from the UI at loading time.
    When the game start the function `start` is called with as arguments a dictionary of the properties' name and value.
    The `update` function is called every frames during the logic stage before running logics bricks,
    the goal of this function is to handle and process everything.The following component example moves and rotates the object when pressing the keys W, A, S and D.Since the components are loaded for the first time outside the bge, then `bge` is a fake module that contains only the class
    `~bge.types.KX_PythonComponent` to avoid importing all the bge modules.
    This behavior is safer but creates some issues at loading when the user want to use functions or attributes from the bge modules other
    than the `~bge.types.KX_PythonComponent` class. The way is to not call these functions at loading outside the bge. To detect it, the bge
    module contains the attribute `__component__` when it's imported outside the bge.The following component example add a "Cube" object at initialization and move it along x for each update. It shows that the user can
    use functions from scene and load the component outside the bge by setting global attributes in a condition at the beginning of the
