        There are a few different strategies we might use to obtain a route signature.
        In order of preference:

        1.  Obtain a signature at some point during the request; this string is set on
            `context.view_func_str`. For supported frameworks, this is accomplished with
            framework-specific patches. One exception to this is aiohttp, where it
            happens directly in the middleware. It is essential that for a particular
            route this signature exactly matches the one found during route discovery.
            In the future, all frameworks will take this approach.

        2.  If context.view_func_str isn't set, we didn't get any framework-specific
            information about the view function. In this case we use the request's
            normalized URI as the signature. We expect to hit this case in pure WSGI /
            ASGI.

        Framework-specific route observation code should set either view_func_str, which
        takes priority, or view_func. It doesn't make sense to set both, since only
        view_func_str would be used in that case.
