    """Create a pipeline from a function located on a remote repository or locally.

    Use :obj:`CREATION_PARAMETER_VALUE` to explicitly set a value to null or fall back
    on project information.
    You can also use :obj:`container_config.included_folders` to specify the files and
    folders required for the pipeline execution. This is useful if your repository
    contains large files that are not required for the pipeline execution, such as
    documentation or test files. Indeed there is a maximum limit of 5MB for the
    total size of the content specified with :obj:`included_folders`.

    Args:
        pipeline_name (:obj:`str`): Name of the pipeline to be created.
        function_path (:obj:`str`, optional): Path to the file that contains the
            function. This parameter is required if parameter "dockerfile_path"
            is not specified.
        function_name (:obj:`str`, optional): Name of the function in that file.
            This parameter is required if parameter "dockerfile_path" is not
            specified.
        description (:obj:`str`, optional): Description. Defaults to None.
        container_config (:obj:`dict[str, str]`, optional): Some pipeline configuration,
            with the following optional keys:

            * ``"language"`` (:obj:`str`): Language and version used for the pipeline.
              Defaults to falling back on project information. The accepted formats
              are "python:3.X-slim", where "3.X" is a supported version of Python,
              and "python-cuda:3.X-Y.Z" for GPU environments, where "Y.Z" is a
              supported version of CUDA. The list of supported versions is available
              on the official documentation website at
              https://mlops-platform-documentation.craft.ai.
            * ``"repository_url"`` (:obj:`str`): Remote repository url.
              Defaults to falling back on project information.
            * ``"repository_branch"`` (:obj:`str`): Branch name. Defaults to falling
              back on project information.
            * ``"repository_deploy_key"`` (:obj:`str`): Private SSH key of the
              repository.
              Defaults to falling back on project information, can be set to null.
              The key should retain the header/footer beacon with : "BEGIN/END RSA
              PRIVATE KEY".
            * ``"requirements_path"`` (:obj:`str`): Path to the requirements.txt
              file. Environment variables created through
              :func:`create_or_update_environment_variable` can be used
              in requirements.txt, as in ``"${ENV_VAR}"``.
              Defaults to falling back on project information, can be set to null.
            * ``"included_folders"`` (:obj:`list[str]`): List of folders and files
              in the repository required for the pipeline execution.
              Defaults to falling back on project information, can be set to null.
              Total size of included_folders must be less than 5MB.
            * ``"system_dependencies"`` (:obj:`list[str]`): List of system
              dependencies.
              Defaults to falling back on project information, can be set to null.
            * ``"dockerfile_path"`` (:obj:`str`): Path to the Dockerfile. This
              parameter should only be used as a last resort and for advanced use.
              When specified, the following parameters should be set to null:
              ``"function_path"``, ``"function_name"``, ``"language"``,
              ``"requirements_path"`` and ``"system_dependencies"``.
            * ``"local_folder`` (:obj:`str`): Path to local folder where the pipeline is
              stored.

        inputs(`list` of instances of :class:`Input`): List of inputs. Each
            parameter of the pipeline function should be specified as an instance of
            :class:`Input` via this parameter `inputs`.
            During the execution of the pipeline, the value of the inputs would be
            passed as function arguments.
        outputs(`list` of instances of :class:`Output`): List of the pipeline
            outputs. For the pipeline to have outputs, the function should return a
            :obj:`dict` with the name of the output as keys and the value of the
            output as values. Each output should be specified as an instance
            of :class:`Output` via this parameter `outputs`.
        timeout_s (:obj:`int`): Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the pipeline to
            be created. 3min (180s) by default, and at least 2min (120s).
