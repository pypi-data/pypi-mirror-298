## About The Project

The goal of this project is to create a simple framework
for [hyperparameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)) tuning of machine learning models,
like Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting Trees, using a genetic algorithm. Evaluating the fitness of an individual in
a population requires training a model with a specific set of hyperparameters, which is a time-consuming task. To
address this issue, we offer a controller-worker system: multiple workers can perform model training and
cross-validation of individuals provided by a controller while this controller manages the generation of offspring
through reproduction and mutation.

*"Parameter tuning is a dark art in machine learning, the optimal parameters of a model can depend on many scenarios."*
~ [XGBoost tutorial](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/param_tuning.html) on Parameter Tuning

*"The number of possible network structures increases exponentially with the number of layers in the network, which
inspires us to adopt the genetic algorithm to efficiently traverse this large search space."* ~
[Genetic CNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01513)

## Installation

```bash
pip install gentun
```

Some model handlers require additional libraries. You can also install their dependencies with:

```bash
pip install "gentun[xgboost]"  # or "gentun[tensorflow]"
```

To setup a development environment, run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install 'flit>=3.8.0'
flit install --deps develop --extras tensorflow,xgboost
```

## Usage

### Single Node

The most basic way to run the algorithm is using a single machine, as shown in the following example where we use it to
find the optimal hyperparameters of an [`xgboost`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) model. First, we download
a sample dataset:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

data = load_iris()
x_train = data.data
y_train = data.target
```

Next, we need to define the hyperparameters we want to optimize:

```python
from gentun.genes import RandomChoice, RandomLogUniform

genes = [
    RandomLogUniform("learning_rate", minimum=0.001, maximum=0.1, base=10),
    RandomChoice("max_depth", [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]),
    RandomChoice("min_child_weight", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]),
]
```

We are using the `gentun.models.xgboost.XGBoost` handler, which performs k-fold cross validation with available train
data and returns an average metric over the folds. Thus, we need to define some static parameters which are shared
across the population over all generations:

```python
kwargs = {
    "booster": "gbtree",
    "objective": "multi:softmax",
    "metrics": "mlogloss",  # The metric we want to minimize with the algorithm
    "num_class": 3,
    "nfold": 5,
    "num_boost_round": 5000,
    "early_stopping_rounds": 100,
}
```

Finally, we are ready to run our genetic algorithm. `gentun` will check that all the model's required parameters are
passed either through genes or keyword arguments.

```python
from gentun.algorithms import Tournament
from gentun.models.xgboost import XGBoost
from gentun.populations import Population

# Run the genetic algorithm with a population of 50 for 100 generations
population = Population(genes, XGBoost, 50, x_train, y_train, **kwargs)
algorithm = Tournament(population)
algorithm.run(100, maximize=False)
```

As shown above, when the model and genes are implemented, experimenting with the genetic algorithm is simple. See for
example how easily can the Genetic CNN paper
be [defined on the MNIST handwritten digits set](examples/geneticcnn_mnist.py).

Note that in genetic algorithms, the *fitness* of an individual is a number to be maximized. By default, this framework
follows this convention. Nonetheless, to make the framework more flexible, you can use the `maximize=False` parameter in
`algorithm.run()` to override this behavior and minimize your fitness metric (e.g. when you want to minimize the loss,
for example *rmse* or *binary crossentropy*).

#### Adding Pre-defined Individuals

Oftentimes, it's convenient to initialize the genetic algorithm with some known individuals instead of a random
population. You can add custom individuals to the population before running the genetic algorithm if you already have
an intuition of which hyperparameters work well with your model:

```python
from gentun.models.xgboost import XGBoost
from gentun.populations import Population


# Best known parameters
hyperparams = {
    "learning_rate": 0.1,
    "max_depth": 9,
    "min_child_weight": 1,
}

# Generate a random population and then add a custom individual
population = Population(genes, XGBoost, 49, x_train, y_train, **kwargs)
population.add_individual(hyperparams)
```

#### Performing a Grid Search

Grid search is also widely used for hyperparameter optimization. This framework provides `gentun.populations.Grid`,
which can be used to conduct a grid search over a single generation pass. You must use genes which define the `sample()`
method, so that uniformly distributed hyperparameter values are obtained with it.

```python
from gentun.genes import RandomChoice, RandomLogUniform
from gentun.models.xgboost import XGBoost
from gentun.populations import Grid


genes = [
    RandomLogUniform("learning_rate", minimum=0.001, maximum=0.1, base=10),
    RandomChoice("max_depth", [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]),
    RandomChoice("min_child_weight", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]),
]

gene_samples = [10, 8, 11]  # How many samples we want to get from each gene

# Generate a grid of individuals
population = Grid(genes, XGBoost, gene_samples, x_train, y_train, **kwargs)
```

Running the genetic algorithm on this population for just one generation is equivalent to doing a grid search over 10
`learning_rate` values, all `max_depth` values between 3 and 10, and all `min_child_weight` values between 0 and 10.

### Multiple Nodes

You can speed up the genetic algorithm by using several machines to evaluate individuals in parallel. One of node has to
act as a *controller*, generating populations and running the genetic algorithm. Each time this *controller* node needs
to evaluate an individual from a population, it will send a request to a job queue that is processed by *workers* which
receive the model's hyperparameters and perform model fitting through k-fold cross-validation. The more *workers* you
run, the faster the algorithm will evolve each generation.

#### Redis Setup

The simplest way to start the Redis service that will host the communication queues is through `docker`:

```shell
docker run -d --rm --name gentun-redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

#### Controller Node

To run the distributed genetic algorithm, define a `gentun.services.RedisController` and pass it to the `Population`
instead of the `x_train` and `y_train` data. When the algorithm needs to evaluate the fittest individual, it will pass
the hyperparameters to a job queue in Redis and wait till all the individual's fitness are evaluated by worker
processes. Once this is done, the mutation and reproduction steps are run by the controller and a new generation is
produced.

```python
from gentun.models.xgboost import XGBoost
from gentun.services import RedisController

controller = RedisController("experiment", host="localhost", port=6379)
# ... define genes
population = Population(genes, XGBoost, 100, controller=controller, **kwargs)
# ... run algorithm
```

#### Worker Nodes

The worker nodes are defined using the `gentun.services.RedisWorker` class and passing the handler to it. Then, we use
its `run()` method with train data to begin processing jobs from the queue. You can use as many nodes as desired as long
as they have network access to the redis server.

```python
from gentun.models.xgboost import XGBoost
from gentun.services import RedisWorker

worker = RedisWorker("experiment", XGBoost, host="localhost", port=6379)

# ... fetch x_train and y_train
worker.run(x_train, y_train)
```
