# Injury Summary Generator

This project automates the process of creating a demand letter for a client based on medical records in PDF format. It extracts relevant information from medical records and generates a "Summary of Injuries" section in a table format.

## Data Source

The ICD-10 codes used in this project are sourced from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website. You can find the official ICD-10 code lists at:

https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coordination-benefits-recovery/overview/icd-code-lists

This authoritative source ensures that our project uses up-to-date and accurate ICD-10 codes for classifying diagnoses.

## Features

- **PDF Processing**: Reads multiple PDF files containing medical records and extracts text.
- **Information Extraction**: Extracts key information such as visit dates, diagnoses, and page numbers.
- **ICD-10 Code Determination**: Determines appropriate ICD-10 codes for extracted diagnoses.
- **PDF Generation**: Creates a summary PDF with a formatted table of extracted information.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izgorodin/injury-summary-generator.git
   cd injury-summary-generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script with the following command:

```bash
python src/generate_summary_of_injuries.py <input_folder> <output_folder>
```

Where:
- `<input_folder>` is the path to the folder containing the medical record PDF files.
- `<output_folder>` is the path where the output summary PDF will be saved.
