"""Structured workflows

Structured workflows are a sequence of tasks and steps, where you can use one or
more AIs to get some workflow done. All tasks and steps are "durable", meaning
that their state is checkpointed and can be resumed from. Your LLM agents have
memories about the previous tasks and steps in the workflow, and can save and
load forms and documents that they are processing as part of the workflow.

You can think of Fixpoint structured workflows kind of like Temporal workflows,
but supercharged with the extra features that LLM systems need, like memory,
RAG, and tools for parsing structured output from unstructured documents.
