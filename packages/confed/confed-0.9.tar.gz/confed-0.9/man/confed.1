[setting] [value]
.IP
Programatically update a setting in a configuration file
.IP
The settings should be defined on a single line. Multi\-line syntax
is not currently supported.
.IP
Options configure the characters allowed in setting names and values,
as well as the character used for assigment (between the setting name
and its value) and to introduce comments.
.IP
Use \fB\-m\fR/\-\-multiple for settings that can be repeated.
Examples include:
.IP
Defaults in the sudoers configuration
exec\- and many others in uwsgi configuration
.IP
It is up to you to specify explicitly if mulptiple entries are
permitted. Failure to do so will see your setting alone
configured (and all other mentions commented out).
.IP
Checking the results of any confed using the \fB\-t\fR/\-\-test option
is highly recommended, most especially if using \fB\-I\fR/\-\-Inplace for
in place reconfiguration (no backup is made by this utility, that
is your responsibility).
