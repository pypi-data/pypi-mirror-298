Each of these regions have set of countries they are "in charge of":\n\nNoA:\n  * Canada\n  * Mexico\n  * United Stated\n  \nNoE:\n  * Every country in the European Union\n  * Australia\n  * New Zealand\n  * South Africa\n  \nNoJ:\n  * Japan\n  \n### nsuid\n\nAn nsuid is a 14 digit long string which Nintendo uses to identify games on each region. \nTaking Breath of the Wild as an example, we have these 3 nsuids for it (one per region):\n\n```    \n  * 70010000000025 (NA)\n  * 70010000000023 (EU)\n  * 70010000000026 (JP)\n```\n    \n### Product Code\n\nThe product code is another type of ID that Nintendo uses, it usually is a 8/9 character long string.\nTaking Splatoon 2 as an example, we have these 3 product codes for it (one per region):\n\n```\n  * HACPAAB6B (NA)\n  * HACPAAB6C (EU)\n  *  HACAAB6A (JP)\n```\n\nThe difference with the nsuid is that the product code has a constant between all regions (`AAB6` in this example), \nand this is what I decided to call [unique_id](https://github.com/fedecalendino/nintendeals/blob/master/nintendeals/commons/classes/games.py#L56) \nand it is what we can you to join a game across all regions.\n\nYou can also see this code in the front of your Nintendo Switch [cartridge](https://media.karousell.com/media/photos/products/2019/08/17/splatoon_2_cartridge_only_1566040350_4f38e061_progressive.jpg).\n\n## Services\n\nThis library provides three types of services: Info, Listing, Searching and Pricing. Each region has a different \nversion of Info, Listing and Searching, but Pricing is the same for all as it only requires a country and an nsuid.\n\n### Listing\n\nEven thought there are different version for each region, they all work in the same way. Given a supported \nplatform ([for this library](https://github.com/fedecalendino/nintendeals/blob/master/nintendeals/constants.py#L15))\nthey will retrieve a list games in the selected region (in the form of an iterator).\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noa\n\nfor game in noa.list_switch_games():\n    print(game.title, "/", game.nsuid)\n```\n\n```text\n>> ARMS / 70010000000392\n>> Astro Duel Deluxe / 70010000000301\n>> Axiom Verge / 70010000000821\n>> Azure Striker GUNVOLT: STRIKER PACK / 70010000000645\n>> Beach Buggy Racing / 70010000000721\n```\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noe\n\nfor game in noe.list_switch_games():\n    print(game.title, "/", game.nsuid)\n```\n\n```text\n>> I and Me / 70010000000314\n>> In Between / 70010000009184\n>> Ghost 1.0 / 70010000001386\n>> Resident Evil 0 / 70010000012848\n>> 64.0 / 70010000020867\n```\n\n### Searching\n\nBuilt on top of the listing services, these provide a simple way to search for games by title or release_date:\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noa\n\nfor game in noa.search_switch_games(query="Zelda"):\n    print(game.title, "/", game.nsuid)\n```\n\n```text\n>> The Legend of Zelda™: Link’s Awakening / 70010000020033\n>> The Legend of Zelda™: Link\'s Awakening: Dreamer Edition / None\n>> Cadence of Hyrule: Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda / 70010000021364\n>> The Legend of Zelda™: Breath of the Wild / 70010000000025\n```\n\n\n### Info\n\nOnce you have the nsuid of the game that you want, you can call the `game_info` service. And again, each region has their\nown version but they all work the same, but keep in mind that you need to use the correct nsuid for each region.\nComing back to the nsuid of Breath of the Wild as an example:\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noa\n\ngame = noa.game_info("70010000000025")\nprint(game.title)\nprint(game.product_code, game.unique_id)\nprint(game.release_date)\nprint(game.players)\nprint(str(game.rating[0]), game.rating[1])\nprint(game.eshop.ca_fr)\n\nfor feature, value in game.features.items():\n    print(" *", str(feature), ":", value)\n```\n\n```text\n>> The Legend of Zelda™: Breath of the Wild\n>> HACPAAAAA AAAA\n>> 2017-03-03 00:00:00\n>> 1\n>> ESRB Everyone 10+\n>> https://www.nintendo.com/fr_CA/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch\n>>  * Demo Available : False\n>>  * DLC Available : False\n>>  * Nintendo Switch Online Required : True\n>>  * Save Data Cloud Supported : True\n```\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noe\n\ngame = noe.game_info("70010000000023")\nprint(game.title)\nprint(game.product_code, game.unique_id)\nprint(game.release_date)\nprint(game.players)\nprint(str(game.rating[0]), game.rating[1])\nprint(game.eshop.uk_en)\n\nfor feature, value in game.features.items():\n    print(" *", str(feature), ":", value)\n```\n\n```text\n>> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\n>> HACPAAAAA AAAA\n>> 2017-03-03 00:00:00\n>> 1\n>> PEGI 12\n>> https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-1173609.html\n>>  * Amiibo Supported : True\n>>  * Demo Available : False\n>>  * DLC Available : False\n>>  * Nintendo Switch Online Required : False\n>>  * Save Data Cloud Supported : True\n>>  * Voice Chat Supported : False\n```\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noj\n\ngame = noj.game_info("70010000000026")\nprint(game.title)\nprint(game.product_code, game.unique_id)\nprint(game.release_date)\nprint(game.players)\nprint(str(game.rating[0]), game.rating[1])\nprint(game.eshop.jp_jp)\n\nfor feature, value in game.features.items():\n    print(" *", str(feature), ":", value)\n```\n\n```text\n>> ゼルダの伝説\u3000ブレス オブ ザ ワイルド\n>> HACAAAAA AAAA\n>> 2017-03-03 00:00:00\n>> 1\n>> CERO B\n>> https://store-jp.nintendo.com/list/software/70010000000026.html\n>>  * Amiibo Supported : True\n>>  * DLC Available : True\n>>  * Nintendo Switch Online Required : False\n```\n\n\n### Pricing\n\nGiven a country code (using the alpha-2 iso standard) and a game or list of games this service will fetch the current \npricing of that/those games for that country. Since this service uses nsuids to fetch the price, make sure that the\ngames that you provide have the regional nsuid that matches the country that you want. For example, only the nsuid for\nthe American region will be able to fetch you the prices of Canada, Mexico and United Stated but not for Japan or Spain.\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noe\nfrom nintendeals.api import prices\n\ngame = noe.game_info("70010000007705")\nprint(game.title)\nprint()\n\nprice = prices.get_price(game, country="CZ")  # Czech Republic\nprint(price.currency)\nprint(price.value)\nprint(price.sale_discount, "%")\nprint(price.sale_value)\nprint(price.sale_start)\nprint(price.sale_end)\n\n# Alternatively you can do this for the same effect:\nprice = game.price(country="CZ") \n``` \n\n```text\nDead Cells\n\nCZK\n625.0\n80 %\n500.0\n2020-04-19 22:00:00\n2020-05-03 21:59:59\n```\n\nTo reduce the amount of call to the prices api, you can also use the `get_prices` service that works in a similar way\nbut it expects a list of games instead of only one:\n\n```python\nfrom nintendeals import noa\nfrom nintendeals.api import prices\n\nbotw = noa.game_info("70010000000025")\nprint(botw.title)\nceleste = noa.game_info("70010000006442")\nprint(celeste.title)\n\nprint()\n\nprices = prices.get_prices([botw, celeste], country="US")\nfor nsuid, price in prices:\n    print(nsuid)\n    print(price.value)\n    print(price.sale_value)\n    print()\n```\n\n```text\nThe Legend of Zelda™: Breath of the Wild\nCeleste\n\n70010000000025\n59.99\nNone\n\n70010000006442\n19.99\n4.99\n```\n',
