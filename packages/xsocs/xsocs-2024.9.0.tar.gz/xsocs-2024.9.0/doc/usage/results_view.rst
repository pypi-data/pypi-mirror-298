Fit/COM Results View
====================

This view displays the results generated by the **fit/COM** process.

The left panel shows a preview of the results.
Each of those "preview" thumbnails can be dragged and dropped to one of the scatter plots in the center of the window (in the **Maps** panel).

After selecting a map to display, points can be selected by clicking on the scatter plot.
The results along each Q space axis will then be displayed on the three plots on the right (in the **Fit** panel).


Gaussian fit results

   Gaussian fit results view

Available results are:

* **Area**
* **Center** position
* **Sigma**: Standard deviation

The corresponding legends of the right panel plots are:

* **Blue dashed curve**: Integrated intensity on the whole Q space
* **Blue solid curve**: Integrated intensity in the Q space ROI (only when a ROI is set)
* **Dark dashed curve**: Background (only if background is used)
* **Red solid curve**: Fitted gaussian (+ background)


Centroid/Max results
--------------------

   Center-of-mass/Max results view

Available results are:

* **COM**: Center of mass
* **I_max**: Maximum intensity
* **I_sum**: Integrated intensity
* **Pos_max**: Position of maximum

The corresponding legends of the right panel plots are:

* **Blue dashed curve**: Integrated intensity on the whole Q space
* **Blue solid curve**: Integrated intensity in the Q space ROI (only when a ROI is set)
* **Dark dashed curve**: Background (only if background is used)
* **Vertical black line**: centroid position
* **Vertical gray line**: maximum position
