from qr_code import ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_H, ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_Q, ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_M, ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_L
```

2. **Create a QR Code**
You can create a QR code with a specified version or use the default version:

``` python
qr = QrCode(version=6)
```

Or simply:

``` python
qr = QrCode()
```

3. **Set Error Correction Level**
Set the error correction level or leave it as default (level L):

``` python
qr.set_error_correction_level(ERROR_CORRECTION_LEVEL_H)
```

4. **Generate Matrix**
Generate the QR code matrix for a given data:

``` python
matrix = qr.generate("https://www.qrcode.com/")
```

5. **Print QR Code to Console**
Print the QR code matrix to the console:

``` python
qr.print_qr(matrix)
```

6. **Save QR Code as Image**
