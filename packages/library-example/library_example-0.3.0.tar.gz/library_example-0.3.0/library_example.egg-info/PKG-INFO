# Python Library Creation
## This is a simple example

### Required Libraries

```
pip install setuptools wheel twine
```

### Project Structure

```
library_example/
	library_example/
	  __init__.py
	  main.py
	setup.py
	Readme.md
```

### Build library for distribution

- sdist: distribute scripts
- bdist_wheel: distribute binary

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

From the wheel (.whl) file created in the last step we can install the library locally.  This will make it available for testing.


Local Install

```
pip install dist/library_example-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```


## Create a CLI Command

Extend the setup.py by adding the following entry_point section:

```
setup(
  ...
  entry_points={
      "console_scripts": [
        "library_example = library_example:hello",
      ],
  }
)
```

## Pushing to PyPi

```
twine upload dist/*
```

As this command will ask for authentication one can instead of manually entering credentials use environment variables:

This will work with api tokens or username/password

```
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-xxxx
```
