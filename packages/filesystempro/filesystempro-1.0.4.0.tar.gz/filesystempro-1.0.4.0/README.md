# Console

```py
from filesystem import console as fsconsole
```

Console is a robust library designed to enable ANSI escape character sequences, which are used for generating colored terminal text and cursor positioning.
This library is a key addition to FileSystemPro as a third-party library, enhancing the toolkit for developers who require consistent terminal styling across different operating systems.

## Features

- **Universal Compatibility:** Console ensures that applications or libraries utilizing ANSI sequences for colored output on Unix or Macs can now operate identically on Windows systems.
- **Simplified Integration:** With no dependencies other than the standard library, integrating Console into your projects is straightforward. Itâ€™s tested across multiple Python versions, ensuring reliability.
- **Enhanced Terminal Experience:** By converting ANSI sequences into appropriate win32 calls, Console allows Windows terminals to emulate the behavior of Unix terminals, providing a consistent user experience.
- **Effortless Transition:** For developers transitioning to FileSystemPro, incorporating Console into your workflow is effortless, enabling you to maintain the visual aspects of your terminal applications without platform constraints.

<summary>Console: Printing a red foreground text message</summary>

The following example shows how to print some red foreground texts using **Console**

```py
from filesystem import console as fsconsole

# This will print a spaced text to your print message
print(fsconsole.foreground.RED, "This is a warn message")

# This will print a no space text to your print message
print(fsconsole.foreground.RED + "This is another warn message")

# You can use f-string format to assign the color to your print
print(f'{fsconsole.foreground.RED}This is a new warn message{fsconsole.foreground.RESET}')

# This text will be printed without color (default)
print("This is a normal text")
```

Output:

<pre><code><span style="color: red;"> This is a warn message
This is another warn message
This is a new warn message</span>
<span">This is a normal text</span></code></pre>

</details>


<details>
<summary>Console: Printing a blue background text message</summary>

The following example shows how to print some blue background texts using **Console**

```py
from filesystem import console as fsconsole

# This will print a spaced text to your print message
print(fsconsole.background.BLUE, 'This is a blue background message')

# This will print a no space text to your print message
print(fsconsole.background.BLUE + 'This is another blue background message')

# You can use f-string format to assign the color to your print
print(f'{fsconsole.background.BLUE}This is a new blue background message{fsconsole.background.RESET}')

# This text will be printed without color (default)
print('This is a normal text')
```

Output:

<pre><code><span style="background-color: #ADD8E6;"> This is a blue background message
This is another blue background warn message
This is a new blue background message</span>
<span">This is a normal text</span></code></pre>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Console: Different foregrounds, backgrounds and styles</summary>

The following example shows how to print some texts with different backgrounds, foregrounds and styles using **Console**

```py
# Prints a red foreground text
print(f'{fsconsole.foreground.RED}Some red text')
# Prints a red foreground text with a green background
print(f'{fsconsole.background.GREEN}And with a green background{fsconsole.style.RESET_ALL}')
# Prints a dim normal text with no background
print(f'{fsconsole.style.DIM}And in dim text{fsconsole.style.RESET_ALL}')
# Prints a normal text
print('Back to normal color')
```

Output:

<pre><code><span style="color: red;">Some red text</span>
<span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: red">And with a green background</span>
<span style="color: #A9A9A9">And in dim text</span>
<span>Back to normal color</span>
</code></pre>

</details>

Remember, for the color changes to work, your Terminal must support ANSI escape sequences, which are used to set the color. Not all Terminals do, so if youâ€™re not seeing the colors as expected, that could be why.

# Wrapper

```py
from filesystem import wrapper as wra
```

Wrapper is a comprehensive toolkit that provides a set of utility functions specifically designed to facilitate file and directory operations. These operations may include creating, reading, updating, and deleting files or directories.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Status</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>wrapper.combine(*args, paths=[])</td>
    <td>
      This function is designed to combine file or directory paths. It takes any number of arguments *args and an optional parameter paths which is a list of paths. The function returns a combined path based on the inputs.
      If the paths list is provided, the function uses it to combine paths. It starts with the first path in the list and checks if itâ€™s an absolute path. If itâ€™s not, it raises a ValueError with a detailed error message. Then, it iterates over the rest of the paths in the list. If a path is absolute, it replaces the current result with this path. If a path is relative, it joins this path to the current result. Finally, it returns the combined path.
      If the paths list is not provided or is empty, the function uses the arguments passed *args. It starts with the first argument and checks if itâ€™s an absolute path. If itâ€™s not, it raises a ValueError with a detailed error message. Then, it iterates over the rest of the arguments. If an argument is an absolute path, it replaces the current result with this path. If an argument is a relative path and not an empty string, it adds this path to the current result. If the current result doesnâ€™t end with a separator (os.sep), it adds one before adding the path. Finally, it returns the combined path.
      <br><br><strong>Please note:</strong> This function does not check if the paths exist or are valid, it only combines them based on the rules described. Itâ€™s up to the caller to ensure that the paths are valid and exist if necessary.
      <br><br>This method is intended to concatenate individual strings into a single string that represents a file path. However, if an argument other than the first contains a rooted path, any previous path components are ignored, and the returned string begins with that rooted path component. As an alternative to the combine method, consider using the join method.

      This function takes a file or directory path as input and returns a dictionary containing various attributes of the file or directory. These attributes include the time of last modification, creation time, last access time, name, size, absolute path, parent directory, whether it's a directory or file or link, whether it exists, and its extension (if it's a file).

      Calculates the size of the file or directory at the specified path. If the path is a directory, 
      it calculates the total size of all files in the directory. The size is returned in bytes, KB, 
      MB, GB, or TB, depending on the size.

      This function is designed to concatenate directory paths. It takes four optional string parameters <strong>path1</strong>, <strong>path2</strong>, <strong>path3</strong>, <strong>path4</strong> and an optional list of paths paths. The function returns a single string that represents the concatenated path.
      <br>For each of the parameters <strong>path1</strong>, <strong>path2</strong>, <strong>path3</strong> and <strong>path4</strong>, the function checks if the path ends with a separator. If it doesnâ€™t, and the path is not an empty string, it adds a separator to the end of the path.
      If the paths list is provided and is not empty, the function iterates over each item in the list. For each item, it checks if the item ends with a separator. If it doesnâ€™t, it adds a separator to the end of the item.
      Finally, the function returns the concatenated path.
      <br><br><strong>Please note:</strong> This function does not check if the paths exist or are valid, it only combines them based on the rules described. Itâ€™s up to the caller to ensure that the paths are valid and exist if necessary.
      <br><br>Unlike the <strong>combine</strong> method, the <strong>join</strong> method does not attempt to root the returned path. (That is, if <strong>path2</strong> or <strong>path3</strong> or <strong>path4</strong> is an absolute path, the <strong>join</strong> method does not discard the previous paths as the <strong>combine</strong> method does).

## Sample Codes

<details>
<summary>Wrapper: Make a zip file</summary>

Creates a zip archive of the specified source directory or file and moves it to the specified destination using **Wrapper**

- Creates a zip archive of a **directory** and moves it to a destination.

```python
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

wra.make_zip("/path/to/directory", "/path/to/directory.zip")
```

- Creates a zip archive of a **file** and moves it to a destination.

```python
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

wra.make_zip("/path/to/file.txt", "/path/to/file.zip")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Wrapper: Has Extension</summary>

Checks if the given file path has an extension

```python
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

bool_extension = wra.has_extension("/path/to/file.txt")
print(bool_extension)
```

Output

```sh
True
```

This will return **True** because the file has an extension (.txt).

---

Checks if the given file path has an extension

```python
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

bool_extension = wra.has_extension("/path/to/file")
print(bool_extension)
```

Output

```sh
False
```

This will return **False** because the file does not have an extension.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Wrapper: Get size of file or directory</summary>

Calculates the size of the file or directory at the specified path.

```py
import filesystem as fs
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

documents_size = wra.get_size(fs.documents)

print(documents_size)
```

Output:

```sh
1.6 GB
```

# Watcher

```py
from filesystem import watcher as wat
```

Watcher serves as a monitoring system for the file system. It keeps track of any changes made within the file system, such as the creation of new files, modification of existing files, or deletion of files. This feature allows for real-time updates and can be particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining the integrity and up-to-date status of the file system is crucial.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>init(self, root)</td>
    <td>
      This is the constructor method that initializes the Watcher object with a root directory to watch. It also saves the current state of the file system in <strong>self.saved_state</strong>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>get_state(self, path):</td>
    <td>
      This method returns a dictionary where the keys are the absolute paths of all files in the given path and the values are file metadata obtained from the <strong>wrapper.enumerate_files(path)</strong> function.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>diff(self)</td>
    <td>
      This method compares the current state of the file system with the saved state and identifies any changes (created, updated, or removed files). It returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the metadata of a changed file and an additional key "change" indicating the type of change.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>str(self)</td>
    <td>
      This method returns a string representation of the <strong>Watcher</strong> object.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
</table>

This class could be useful in scenarios where you need to monitor changes to a file system, for example, in a backup system or a live syncing service.

## Sample Codes

<details>
<summary>Watcher: Monitoring Documents Folder</summary>

This Watcher example is designed to monitor changes in **Documents** directory and print out the changes as they occur.

```py
# Native library
import time
from datetime import datetime

# FileSystemPro
import filesystem as fs
from filesystem import watcher as wat

# Create a new instance of Watcher class
watcher = wat.Watcher(f'{fs.documents}')

# Run `diff` method to get directory changes
while True:
    changes = watcher.diff()
    if changes:
        print(f"Changes detected at: {datetime.now()}:")
        for change in changes:
            print(f"{change['abspath']} was {change['change']}")
    time.sleep(5)  # Awaits for 5 seconds before a new verification
```
