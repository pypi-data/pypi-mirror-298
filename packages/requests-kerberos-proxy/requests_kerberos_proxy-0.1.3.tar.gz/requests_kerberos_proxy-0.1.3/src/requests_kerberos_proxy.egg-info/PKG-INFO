=======================
requests-kerberos-proxy
=======================


    An front end to requests in order to use Kerberos behind a proxy


This package provides a work around in order to deal with a proxy if you want to use kerberos


Install
=======

Before installing this module, the underlying Kerberos C libraries and Python development headers need to be installed.
An example of how to do this for some Linux distributions is shown below::

    # For Debian based distros
    apt-get install gcc python3-dev libkrb5-dev

    # For EL based distros
    dnf install gcc python3-devel krb5-devel

For Windows this is not required.
