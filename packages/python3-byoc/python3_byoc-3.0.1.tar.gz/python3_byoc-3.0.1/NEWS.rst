===============

Overview of changes to byoc in reverse chronological order.

3.0.1
=====

  * `FileStore.save_changes() feature (saving modified (dirty) option
    values) has been merged into FileStore.save() which remains the official
    way to save a configuration changes to disk. This finalizes the "lazy
    writing" part of configuration files. `save_changes` was never part of
    the offical API but has been extensively tested in the `byov`
    project. It's now deprecated and will be removed in the next major
    version (4.x).

  * Fix FileStore serialization, if the None section exists it should be
    serialized first (otherwise it gets mixed with the last serialized
    section which can cause duplicated option definitions. This can only
    occur for configuration created in memory.

3.0.0
=====

  * Drop python2 debian packaging.

  * ListOption now accepts a 'separator' argument defaulting to ','.
