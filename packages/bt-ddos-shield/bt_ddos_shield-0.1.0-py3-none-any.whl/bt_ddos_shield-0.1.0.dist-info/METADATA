# BT DDoS Shield

## Overview

`bt-ddos-shield` is a Python package designed to address the critical issue of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in bittensor ecosystem. The project leverages encryption to protect communication between miners and validators, ensuring the IPs and ports of these nodes remain secure and hidden from malicious actors. This decentralized solution aims to eliminate the financial burden caused by traditional DDoS protection methods like WAF and Cloudflare, which are often costly and impractical for subnets handling large volumes of data.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to implement a distributed and decentralized system that:
- Protects miner and validator IP addresses from exposure, preventing potential DDoS attacks.
- Removes the need for on-chain storage of unencrypted IP addresses and ports, eliminating an obvious attack surface.
- Uses encrypted messages between miners and validators to securely exchange connection information (IP, IP version, and port).
- Provides a scalable, decentralized alternative to traditional DDoS protection methods while maintaining performance and minimizing attack vectors.

## Features

1. **Encryption-Based Communication**: 
   - Uses ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) to encrypt communication between miners and validators.
   - The encrypted data includes the miner's hotkey, subnet ID, and validator connection details (IP, IP version, and port).

2. **Decentralized DDoS Mitigation**:
   - Removes the need for centralized DDoS protection services by distributing connection information securely across nodes.
   - Prevents IP address exposure by sharing encrypted connection data through a decentralized network of subtensors.

3. **Secure Message Exchange**:
   - Validators can request the connection information of miners from the subtensor network. This information is validated and decrypted locally using the validator's private key.

4. **Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP)**:
   - The initial version of the system will follow a centralized approach to prototype and test the concept efficiently. If the approach proves effective, the next version will focus on full decentralization.
