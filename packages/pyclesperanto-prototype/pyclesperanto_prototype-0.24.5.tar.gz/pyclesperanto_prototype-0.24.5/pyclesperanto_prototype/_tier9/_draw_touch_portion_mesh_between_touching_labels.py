def draw_touch_portion_mesh_between_touching_labels(labels : Image, touch_portion_mesh_destination : Image = None) -> Image:
    """Starting from a label map, draw lines between touching neighbors resulting in a mesh.
    
    The end points of the lines correspond to the centroids of the labels. The intensity of the lines corresponds
    to the amount the two labels touch divided by the number of border voxels on both labels. Note: label borders at
    image borders are ignored in this calculation.
