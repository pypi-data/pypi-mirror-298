def to_igraph(adjacency_matrix:Image, centroids:Image=None):
    """
    Converts a given adjacency matrix to a iGraph [1] graph data structure.

    Note: the given centroids typically have one entry less than the adjacency matrix is wide, because
    those matrices contain a first row and column representing background. When exporting the networkx graph,
    that first column will be ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency_matrix : Image
        m*m touch-matrix, proximal-neighbor-matrix or n-nearest-neighbor-matrix
    centroids : Image, optional
        d*(m-1) matrix, position list of centroids

    Returns
    -------
    iGraph graph
