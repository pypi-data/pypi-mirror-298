# bacore
Bacore is a business analysis and test automation framework. It is written in Python and is available through
[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/bacore/).

Documentation is available at [bacore.dev](https://bacore.dev).

It is *very* early days for bacore, and the developers would ask you to let it "cook" for a bit longer before trying it
out.
