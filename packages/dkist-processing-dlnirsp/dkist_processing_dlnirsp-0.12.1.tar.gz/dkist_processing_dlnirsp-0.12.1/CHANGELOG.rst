v0.12.1 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.2.1. This fixes a documentation build bug in Airflow.


v0.12.0 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.2.0. This includes upgrading to the latest version of Airflow (2.10.2).


v0.11.2 (2024-09-26)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.1.0. This enables the usage of the `NearFloatBud` and `TaskNearFloatBud` in parsing.


v0.11.1 (2024-09-24)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-processing-common` to v10.0.1. This fixes a bug in the reported FRAMEVOL key in L1 headers. (`#37 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/37>`__)


v0.11.0 (2024-09-23)
====================

Features
--------

- Reorder task dependencies in workflows. Movie and L1 quality tasks are no longer dependent on the presence of OUTPUT
  frames and thus can be run in parallel with the `WriteL1` task. (`#34 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/34>`__)


Misc
----

- Use CALIBRATED instead of OUTPUT frames in post-science movie and quality tasks. This doesn't change their output at all
  (the arrays are the same), but it's necessary for `dkist-processing-common >= 10.0.0` that will break using OUTPUT frames. (`#34 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/34>`__)


v0.10.1 (2024-09-19)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-quality` to v1.1.1. This fixes raincloud plot rendering in trial workflows. (`#35 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/35>`__)


v0.10.0 (2024-09-11)
====================

Misc
----

- Accommodate changes to the GraphQL API associated with refactoring the quality database (`#33 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/33>`__)


v0.9.1 (2024-09-09)
===================

Misc
----

- Use High Memory worker for `InsturmentPolarizationCalibration` task.
  Writing the VIS demodulation matrices to disk is causing some memory issues on STAGE. (`#32 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/32>`__)


v0.9.0 (2024-09-09)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Perform Calibration Unit (CU) and demodulation matrix fits separately for each of the two polarized beams (instead of a
  single CU fit with the average of both beams). (`#30 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/30>`__)


v0.8.0 (2024-09-04)
===================

Features
--------

- Add support for multiple coadds in linearization task. (`#28 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/28>`__)
- Add camera-sample-sequence-based checks of ramp validity during linearization task. (`#29 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/29>`__)


v0.7.1 (2024-08-21)
===================

Misc
----

- Update some Quality related tasks and methods for the new API in `dkist-processing-common` v9.0.0. (`#27 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/27>`__)


Documentation
-------------

- Description of polcal bins in quality report no longer needs to include a dummy dimension. (`#27 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/27>`__)


v0.7.0 (2024-08-19)
===================

Features
--------

- Update linearity correction to average initial bias frames if more than one is found. Uses the last read NDR as opposed to the last NDR, which may be a bias NDR. (`#22 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/22>`__)


v0.6.4 (2024-08-15)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 4.6.0 of `dkist-fits-specifications` to correct allowed values of the TTBLTRCK header keyword.


v0.6.3 (2024-08-12)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 4.5.0 of `dkist-fits-specifications` which includes `PV1_nA` keys for non linear dispersion.


v0.6.2 (2024-08-05)
===================

Documentation
-------------

- Add pre-commit hook for documentation and edit README.rst. (`#18 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/18>`__)


v0.6.1 (2024-08-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Remove the loops from linear interpolation in remapping the ifu cube in order to speed up the code. (`#17 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/17>`__)


v0.6.0 (2024-07-30)
===================

Features
--------

- Update solar gain algorithm to compute a single characteristic spectrum across *all* slitbeams. This helps mitigate
  strong spectral gain feautres that exist across the entire spatial extent of a single slitbeam. (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/25>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Update "Avg Noise" QA metric computation to avoid errors caused by infinity values in the data. (`#16 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/16>`__)
- Calibrated L1 data no longer have large regions of all-NaN data at start and end of wavelength axis. This was fixed by
  constraining the reference "wavelength" axis to exclude regions with a large fraction of NaN values (the specific fraction is a parameter). (`#19 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/19>`__)
- Correctly parse the number of X/Y_tiles in cases where aborts lead to only a single complete mosaic/X_tile.
  This was very unlikely to happen in practice, but does come up in some of our tests. (`#20 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/20>`__)
- IFU cubes now have the correct spatial axis ordering. Previously the difference between numpy and cartesian ordering
  had caused the output spatial axes to be swapped. (`#21 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/21>`__)
- Preserve slitbeam scale differences in final solar gain image. This ensures that these real differences are corrected
  when the solar gain is applied to science data. (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/25>`__)


Misc
----

- Add DEBUG output to Science task that contains the stack slit spectra just prior to IFU remapping (called "SLIT_STACKED"). (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/25>`__)


v0.5.3 (2024-07-26)
===================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-common to v8.2.2 to fix some warning messages. (`#24 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/24>`__)


v0.5.2 (2024-07-19)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 4.4.2 of `dkist-fits-specifications` which includes the `PVi_j` keywords.


v0.5.1 (2024-07-15)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Use `TrialTeardown` task in trial workflow. This task sets the recipe run status to TRIALSUCCESS. (`#15 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/15>`__)


v0.5.0 (2024-07-15)
===================

Features
--------

- L1 output files are now fully remapped IFU cubes! (`#8 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/8>`__)
- Add trial workflow for processing data without activating downstream Data Center services. This is useful for
  making "official" L1 data for assessing the performance of the pipeline. (`#10 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/10>`__)
- Add the `TransferDlnirspTrialData` task. This task is used to collect a set of file produced during a pipeline run
  and move them to a permanent location outside of the local (and ephemeral) scratch. (`#10 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/10>`__)


Misc
----

- Build and upload the Manual Processing Worker (mpw) notebooks as part of the Bitbucket release pipeline. (`#11 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/11>`__)
- Local trial workflows that don't depend on OBSERVE frames (solar-gain-as-science and polcal-as-science) now produce
  the full set of L1 outputs (except the inventory ASDF). (`#12 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/12>`__)
- Bump `dkist-quality` to version 1.1.0. (`#14 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/14>`__)


v0.4.0 (2024-07-12)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Correctly mock/populate OBS_IP_START_TIME in local trial workflows that don't use Observe frames. (`#9 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/9>`__)


Misc
----

- Move to version 8.2.1 of `dkist-processing-common` which includes the publication of select private methods for documentation purposes. (`#13 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/13>`__)


v0.3.0 (2024-07-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Move to version 8.1.0 of `dkist-processing-common` which includes an upgrade to airflow 2.9.2. (`#7 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/7>`__)


v0.2.1 (2024-06-25)
===================

Misc
----

- Remove High Memory Worker requirement from `InstrumentPolarizationCalibration` task. (Should have been part of `PR #4 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/4>`__)
- Pin `twine` to non-breaking version in BitBucket pipeline

v0.2.0 (2024-06-25)
===================

Features
--------

- Greatly reduce memory requirements of `InstrumentPolarizationCalibration` task (and speed it up a little bit, too). (`#4 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/4>`__)


Misc
----

- Use `nd_left_matrix_multiply` from `dkist-processing-math` and remove the local Mixin that had this method. (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Don't initialize a `parameters` object `DlnirspLinearityTaskBase`; we don't use parameters in Linearization. (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Update for new usage of `_find_most_recent_past_value` now requiring `obs_ip_start_time` or explicit time.
- Use `asdf` codecs from `dkist-processing-common` instead of locally defined codecs (they were the same). (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Use `ParameterArmIdMixin` and `_load_param_value_from_fits` from `dkist-processing-common` (they're identical). (`#1 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/1>`__)
- Update all non-DKIST dependencies (and `dkist-processing-pac`) to current versions. (`#2 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/2>`__)
- Remove crufty "build_docs" and "upload_docs" from setup.cfg. (`#2 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/2>`__)
- Put `GroupIdMixin` on `DlnirspTaskBase` instead of using it separately for each Task class. This also helps
  soften the dependencies of the `CorrectionsMixin` on `GroupIdMixin` because now the presence of the `group_id_*` methods
  is guaranteed. (`#3 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/3>`__)
- Use pre-defined `*Tag.task_FOO()` tags and controlled `TaskName.foo` values, when available. (`#5 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/5>`__)


v0.1.1 (2024-06-12)
===================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-fits-specifications` to v4.3.0. We need this in DL-NIRSP so some dither-related keywords are no longer required.
  (They are only present if dithering is used). (`#6 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/6>`__)


v0.1.0 (2024-06-06)
===================

- Initial release. Mostly for first release to DC stacks (i.e., not "production" quality).
