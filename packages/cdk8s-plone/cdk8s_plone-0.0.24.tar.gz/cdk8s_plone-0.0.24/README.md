# CMS Plone Chart for CDK8S

This chart provides a library to bootstrap a Plone deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the [CDK8S](https://cdk8s.io) framework.

It provides

* Backend (for API with `plone.volto` or as Classic-UI)
* Frontend (Plone-Volto, a ReactJS based user interface)
* Varnish using kube-httpcache. It includes a way to invalidate varnish cluster (optional)

### Typescript

To use this library, create a new CDK8S project (or use an existing one)

```bash
cdk8s init typescript-app
```

Then add the following dependency to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bluedynamics/cdk8s-plone": "*"
  }
}
```

Run `npm install` to install the new dependency.

### Python

Todo: Document in details how to install.

```bash
cdk8s init python-app
```

Python package name is [cdk8s-plone](https://pypi.org/project/cdk8s-plone/).

## Usage

With `cdk8s-cli` installed, create a new project:

```bash
cdk8s sythn
```

Add the following code to your `main.ts`:

```python
...
import { Plone } from '@bluedynamics/cdk8s-plone';
...
    super(scope, id, props);

    // define resources here
    new Plone(this, 'Plone', {});
...
```

Run `npm run build ` to generate the Kubernetes manifests.
The manifests are stored in the `dist` directory.

For more have a look at the [example project](https://github.com/bluedynamics/cdk8s-plone-example).

## Development

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
```

nvm use lts/*
npm install yarn
projen

```

Then run the following command to run the test:

```bash
npx projen test
```
