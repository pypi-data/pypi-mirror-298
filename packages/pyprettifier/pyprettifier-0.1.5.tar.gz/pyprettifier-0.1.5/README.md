# PyPrettifier

**PyPrettifier** is a simple Python package for converting between emoji names (like `:smile:`) and actual emoji characters (like ðŸ˜„), and vice versa. It also includes several utility functions to manipulate strings that contain emojis, such as counting, replacing, and removing emojis.

More beautiful feature will uploaded in the future to handle the output and different output format.

In addition an automatic update, emoji retrieval and several other options will be coded.

## Features

- **Convert emoji names to emojis**: Convert emoji names such as `:smile:` to their corresponding emoji characters ðŸ˜„.
- **Convert emojis to emoji names**: Replace emoji characters with their `:emoji_name:` tags.
- **Count emojis**: Count the number of emojis in a string.
- **Remove emojis**: Remove all emoji characters from a string.
- **Replace emojis with custom alternatives**: Replace each emoji in a string with a custom alternative (e.g., descriptive text or themed emojis).
