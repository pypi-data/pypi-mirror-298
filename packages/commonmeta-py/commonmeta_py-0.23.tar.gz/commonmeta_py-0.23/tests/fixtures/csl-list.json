		"abstract": "The incorporation of data sharing into the research lifecycle is an important part of modern scholarly debate. In this study, the DataONE Usability and Assessment working group addresses two primary goals: To examine the current state of data sharing and reuse perceptions and practices among research scientists as they compare to the 2009/2010 baseline study, and to examine differences in practices and perceptions across age groups, geographic regions, and subject disciplines. We distributed surveys to a multinational sample of scientific researchers at two different time periods (October 2009 to July 2010 and October 2013 to March 2014) to observe current states of data sharing and to see what, if any, changes have occurred in the past 3–4 years. We also looked at differences across age, geographic, and discipline-based groups as they currently exist in the 2013/2014 survey. Results point to increased acceptance of and willingness to engage in data sharing, as well as an increase in actual data sharing behaviors. However, there is also increased perceived risk associated with data sharing, and specific barriers to data sharing persist. There are also differences across age groups, with younger respondents feeling more favorably toward data sharing and reuse, yet making less of their data available than older respondents. Geographic differences exist as well, which can in part be understood in terms of collectivist and individualist cultural differences. An examination of subject disciplines shows that the constraints and enablers of data sharing and reuse manifest differently across disciplines. Implications of these findings include the continued need to build infrastructure that promotes data sharing while recognizing the needs of different research communities. Moving into the future, organizations such as DataONE will continue to assess, monitor, educate, and provide the infrastructure necessary to support such complex grand science challenges.",

		"abstract": "The engraved trails of rocks on the nearly flat, dry mud surface of Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park, have excited speculation about the movement mechanism since the 1940s. Rock movement has been variously attributed to high winds, liquid water, ice, or ice flotation, but has not been previously observed in action. We recorded the first direct scientific observation of rock movements using GPS-instrumented rocks and photography, in conjunction with a weather station and time-lapse cameras. The largest observed rock movement involved >60 rocks on December 20, 2013 and some instrumented rocks moved up to 224 m between December 2013 and January 2014 in multiple move events. In contrast with previous hypotheses of powerful winds or thick ice floating rocks off the playa surface, the process of rock movement that we have observed occurs when the thin, 3 to 6 mm, “windowpane” ice sheet covering the playa pool begins to melt in late morning sun and breaks up under light winds of ∼4–5 m/s. Floating ice panels 10 s of meters in size push multiple rocks at low speeds of 2–5 m/min. along trajectories determined by the direction and velocity of the wind as well as that of the water flowing under the ice.",

		"abstract": "Being aware of the motivation problems observed in many scientific oriented careers, we present two experiences to expose to college students to environments, methodologies and discovery techniques addressing contemporary problems. This experiences are developed in two complementary contexts: an Introductory Physics course, where we motivated to physics students to participate in research activities, and a multidisciplinary hotbed of research oriented to advanced undergraduate students of Science and Engineering (that even produced three poster presentations in international conferences). Although these are preliminary results and require additional editions to get statistical significance, we consider they are encouraging results. On both contexts we observe an increase in the students motivation to orient their careers with emphasizing on research. In this work, besides the contextualization support for these experiences, we describe six specific activities to link our students to research areas, which we believe can be replicated on similar environments in other educational institutions.",

		"abstract": "Eight teacher educators used self-study methodology to engage in reflective practice to overcome their isolation as individual teachers and researchers, and to facilitate professional development. Their research question asked: How can we continue to develop our teaching practice to ensure we are high quality, contemporary teacher educators? They contributed collaboratively in one overarching research project as well as through several focussed projects that explored issues in their individual teaching practices including: sustainability, creativity, curriculum design, pedagogy, assessment, and the learning experiences for students. This paper explores the outcomes from collaborative inquiry that five of the eight educator/researchers engaged in during a research-writing retreat. It documents their experience using arts-based strategies in which drawings were created about their experiences of engaging in a collaborative project and smaller focussed self-study projects. Analysis involved inquiring into each other&rsquo;s drawings through recorded conversation. The metaphoric representations found through analysing the drawings provided insight into participants&rsquo; teaching practices and identities as teacher educators. Six months later when the participants had developed their projects further and used other artsbased methods to understand these experiences, they reflected on the key issues for their teaching practices that had arisen from undertaking this Collaborative Reflective Experience and Practice in Education research. Arts-based inquiries and reflective analysis over six months, constitute this paper. The experiences and analyses are shared to show how creating and sharing metaphoric meaning of visual representations is useful in self-study research to drill down into the real issues. Importantly, this in-depth sharing provides authentic interdisciplinary links when individual educators share their own approaches to teaching in their disciplined area. Findings suggest that gaining new insights into each other&rsquo;s discipline-based approaches to teacher education through these methods, revealed different responses to pedagogical challenges and allowed for new possibilities for understanding the landscape of teacher education.",

		"abstract": "Complicated geological structures make it difficult to analyze the stability of rock slopes, such as faults, weak intercalated layers or joint fissures. Based on 3D geological modeling and surface block identifying methods, an integrated methodology framework was proposed and realized to analyze the stability of surface blocks in rock slopes. The surface blocks cut by geological structures, fissures or free faces could be identified subjected to the four principles of closure, completeness, uniqueness and validity. The factor of safety(FOS)of single key block was calculated by the limit equilibrium method. If there were two or more connected blocks, they were defined as a block-group. The FOS of a block-group was computed by the Sarma method. The proposed approach was applied to an actual rock slope of a hydropower project, and some possible instable blocks were demonstrated and analyzed visually. The obtained results on the key blocks or block-groups provide essential information for determining potential instable region of rock slopes and designing effective support scheme in advance.",

		"abstract": "In 2002, we assessed all sites known to us that had been suggested to provide evidence for the association of Clovis-era archaeological material with the remains of extinct Pleistocene mammals in North America. We concluded that, of the 76 sites we assessed, 14 provided compelling evidence for human involvement in the death and/or dismemberment of such mammals. Of these sites, 12 involved mammoth (Mammuthus), the remaining two mastodon (Mammut). Here, we update that assessment. We examine Clovis-era, and earlier, sites reported since 2002, as well as sites examined previously but for which additional information has become available. Our assessment leads us to exclude Hebior (Wisconsin) from the list of accepted sites, and to add El Fin del Mundo (Sonora) and Wally's Beach (Alberta). There are now 15 sites on our list, providing what we find to be compelling evidence for human involvement in the death and/or dismemberment of five genera of now-extinct late Pleistocene mammals: Equus, Camelops, Cuvieronius, Mammut, and Mammuthus. As in 2002, however, we note this is a small fraction of the 37 genera that disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene, and for this and other reasons we remain highly skeptical that human overkill was responsible for their extinction.",

		"abstract": "The ‘Sailing Rocks’ of Death Valley, California are known worldwide, and the enigma of how they move over a desert ground without intervention of animal or human forces, still remains one of the great natural mysteries. There exist different theories about how these movements happen, the most recent was that ice-rafts build up below and around the rocks, which are then pushed forward by moving ice floes. Earlier theories regarding this phenomenon describe the influence of wind, and flows of melting water on fine soil material (Hypothesis of ‘Sailing Rocks’). We describe here the same phenomenon, observed not in a large rock weighing several hundreds of kilograms, but in a small pebble of about 2 cm in size. A clear analysis of the conditions under which its movement took place has allowed the formulation of the minimum conditions under which a rock starts moving. Ice rafts may be sufficient but are not necessary. Here we show that pebbles sail driven by the wind over a watery surface that covers an icy but water saturated substrate, similar to an aquaplaning car. The same physical rules apply whatever the scale, to this small system as well as to the large sailing rocks of Death Valley.",

		"abstract": "This paper sheds light on the hydrodynamic conditions of transport and sedimentary effects of wind-induced water currents produced during strong windstorms in low gradient systems. Repeated field surveys were conducted in a playa lake in central Spain to determine the impacts of major winter storms on the bed form morphology in real time. The succession of storms that passed through the area from mid-December 2013 to early February 2014 left behind a variety of sedimentary structures: mainly ripple marks showing complex patterns and erosional structures. The latter include obstacle scours, grooves and other tool marks. In situ observations revealed that strong storm events in almost flat, extremely shallow lakes (less than 5 cm) have enough hydraulic energy to erode and remove high volumes of sediments and may also lead to large stones sliding across the bed, thus creating long grooves. Sole marks found in ancient continental successions have been typically attributed to fluvial conditions. We suggest that shallow lake basins should not be discounted when storm-generated structures are preserved in ancient rocks. The identification of such sedimentary structures provides valuable information for reconstructing hydrodynamic conditions and paleoclimatic conditions in semi-arid environments.

Portions of 3 skeletal elements and 2 sections of articulated elements were found at the ends of shallow, linear, furrow-like trails inscribed in the playa surface. These trails, with their skeletal material, are similar to those produced by the phenomenon described as “racing” or “sailing rocks” that is best documented from Racetrack Playa in Death Valley, California. As has been recently observed for the rocks of Racetrack Playa, the material here was probably moved by a combination of wind acting on ice floating on liquid water. This is the first report of such movement of objects from Smith Creek Playa and represents a previously unreported mechanism for taphonomic transport of skeletal material.",

		"abstract": "Potential Desiccation Polygons (PDPs), tens to hundreds of meters in size, have been observed in numerous regions on Mars, particularly in ancient (>3 Gyr old) terrains of inferred paleolacustrine/playa geologic setting, and in association with hydrous minerals such as smectites. Therefore, a better understanding of the conditions in which large desiccation polygons form could yield unique insight into the ancient climate on Mars. Many dried lakebeds/playas in western United States display large (>50 m wide) desiccation polygons, which we consider to be analogues for PDPs on Mars. Therefore, we have carried out fieldwork in seven of these dried lakes in San Bernardino and the Death Valley National Park regions complemented with laboratory and spectral analysis of collected samples. Our study shows that the investigated lacustrine/playa sediments have (a) a soil matrix containing ~40–75% clays and fine silt (by volume) where the clay minerals are dominated by illite/muscovite followed by smectite, (b) carbonaceous mineralogy with variable amounts of chloride and sulfate salts, and significantly, (c) roughly similar spectral signatures in the visible-near-infrared (VIS-NIR) range. We conclude that the development of large desiccation fractures is consistent with water table retreat. In addition, the comparison of the mineralogical to the spectral observations further suggests that remote sensing VIS-NIR spectroscopy has its limitations for detailed characterization of lacustrine/playa deposits. Finally, our results imply that the widespread distribution of PDPs on Mars indicates global or regional climatic transitions from wet conditions to more arid ones making them important candidate sites for future in situ missions.",
