=====================
Type Inference module
=====================

This module should contain all the integrations with different type inferences
engines like pyre, mypy, etc.

The main idea is to have a unified interface to all the type inference engines.
This is the main reason for the normalization.py file available here.

For while we will only use pyre integration using the query mechanism.
