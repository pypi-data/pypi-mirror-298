# SimpleBump

Bump a static project.version in pyproject.toml, no config, no hassle. This tool exists because every other tool requires a config or tries to do too much. This one does not.

- The current version is read from pyproject.toml, only a static version is supported intentionally.
- Without flags the current version is displayed.
- If a semver fragment is provided as an argument, that segment is incremented.
- The new version is written back to pyproject.toml, and nowhere else.
