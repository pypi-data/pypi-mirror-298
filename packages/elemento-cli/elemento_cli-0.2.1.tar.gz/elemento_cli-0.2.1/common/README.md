# Elemento Common Libraries
This repository is the mother of all the repos of Elemento's project.
This repository contains everything one needs to describe and store the status of the infrastructure.
Here are implemented the scheduling mechanisms, the hardware crwlers and descriptors and much more.
This repository is meant to be included in many others as submodule and will be compiled in the form of a python package and distributed as such.
