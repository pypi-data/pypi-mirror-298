## Why it goes by `HydrogenLib`?

The element "Hydrogen" is the element that can react the most with his elements,
which is intended to simplify many practical but complex operations in python.
There are nearly 40 modules in the project, from the basic file operations to the advanced socket,
from the underlying data structure to the available database.
This is `HydrogenLib`.
