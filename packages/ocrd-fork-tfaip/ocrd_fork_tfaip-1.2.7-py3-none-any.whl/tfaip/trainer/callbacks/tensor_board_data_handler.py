    """
    The TensorBoardDataHandler allows to customize writing arbitrary data to the TensorBoard.

    Use case: Writing image (see tfaip.scenario.tutorial.full)
        - Add the raw image data (e.g. weights) as output of the model by implementing _outputs_for_tensorboard
        - Overwrite handle to write the data adapted data to the Tensorboard (e.g. tf.summary.write_image())

    Use case: PR Curve
        - The PR-Curve is a Metric of bytes.
        - Add the name of the metric to _tensorboard_only_metrics (to mark this metrik to be only added to tensorboard)
          Note, this step is optional, if the type of the metric is bytes.
        - Overwrite handle to write the actual data with the raw tensorboard writer
