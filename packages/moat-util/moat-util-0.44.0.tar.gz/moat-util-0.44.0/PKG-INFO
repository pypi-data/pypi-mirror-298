====================
Utilities for Python
====================

This is a Python "util" submodule with code that I habitually use in so
many projects that I decided to split it off into its own git archive.

Feel free to extend and embrace. Patches welcome.


Features
========

A few. Read the code and the subpackages' documentation; I didn't get
around to documenting all of that yet.


License
=======

No restrictions. CC0 / public domain / MIT / GPLv3 / whatever, as long as
you don't want anybody (i.e. the author(s)) to pay for the effects of any
bugs, features or "features" which this code might or might not have.

Please contribute any enhancements.


Dependencies
============

A few. Notable:

* anyio, version 3. Required for `ValueEvent`, `spawn` (obviously) and
  `as_service`.

* ruyaml. This is a fork of ruamel.yaml which is a fork of pyyaml.
  Fixes some bugs and has a more reasonable API. Required for
  `yload`/`yprint`/`yformat`.

* msgpack, obviously required for `pack`/`unpack` and `MsgReader`/`MsgWriter`.

* asyncclick, required for `main_`/`wrap_main`.
