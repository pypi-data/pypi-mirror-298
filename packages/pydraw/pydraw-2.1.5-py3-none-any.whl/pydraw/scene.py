    An abstraction of the Screen, designed to store the Screen in a certain state while retaining registered input
    handlers and the positions and attributes of objects registered to it.

    You can use Scenes to create multi-screen games or to manage different levels easily. It works exactly like a screen
    but will not render anything until it is "applied" to a Screen via `Screen.scene(some_scene)`
