*************
What is this?
*************

Heimdall is a tool for converting more easily one or more databases from one format to another.



********************
Why should I use it?
********************

If, for example, you find yourself in one of the following situations...

- you need access to data, but it is not stored in a format compatible with your favorite software...
- you'd prefer to merge several heterogeneous databases into a single corpus, easier to analyze...
- you're considering which input format to use for your software or database...
- you want to make your data more accessible and interoperable...

... then Heimdall can offer you an exchange format, and abstract the details of data implementation: yours, but also those of others.

Thanks to Heimdall, you can also switch from one technology to another in a matter of moments, as and when you need to, without ever losing, disorganizing or corrupting your data.

In a nutshell, **HEIMDALL** is your **H**\ igh **E**\ nd **I**\ nteroperability **M**\ odule when **D**\ ata is **ALL** over the place.
It's a bridge between scattered islands of data.
