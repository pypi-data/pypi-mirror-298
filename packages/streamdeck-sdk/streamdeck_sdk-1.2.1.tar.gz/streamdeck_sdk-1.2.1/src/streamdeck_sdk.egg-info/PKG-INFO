# streamdeck-python-sdk

Library for creating Stream Deck plugins in Python.

**Supported operating systems:**

* MacOS: 10.14 or later
* Windows: 10 or later

**Supported Python versions:** 3.8 or later

## Installation

> ⚠️ For correct operation on Windows, it is recommended to enable `LongPaths` support in
> the system: [manual](https://www.backupery.com/how-to-enable-ntfs-long-paths-in-windows/).
> Without this setting, problems with installation and use may occur!

```shell
pip install "streamdeck-sdk[dev]"
```

During this installation, additional libraries needed for development are installed:

* [streamdeck-sdk-pi](https://pypi.org/project/streamdeck-sdk-pi) - Property Inspector generator in Python

* [streamdeck-sdk-cli](https://pypi.org/project/streamdeck-sdk-cli) - useful command line utilities

> ⚠️ These libraries should not be present in the plugin's `requirements.txt`.

## Features

* Ease of use. You can quickly create your own plugin without having to understand how websockets and
  other technologies work.
* Fully typed, using [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic).
* Includes image to base64 converters for easy installation of icons on keys.
* Includes a decorator for functions and methods to run on a separate thread.
* Exception logging and easy logging configuration.
* Debug mode via `PyCharm` or other debugging tools.
* A complete protocol for interaction with the Stream Deck application has been implemented.
* Quick start of a project via the console command `streamdeck_sdk startproject`.
* Build the project using the `streamdeck_sdk build` console command.
* Property Inspector Generator. Write code in Python and get html and js for PI.

## ⚠️ Limitations

1. During installation and update of the plugin, the Internet must be available.

### Windows

1. Plugin requirements should take no longer than 30 seconds to install. This is a feature of Stream Deck on Windows,
   since the program restarts the plugin if a websocket connection has not been established within 30 seconds.
   Therefore, you need a good Internet connection when installing and updating the plugin.

## Examples

[LoremFlickr](https://github.com/gri-gus/loremflickr-streamdeck-plugin) - Plugin for installing images on a button from
the LoremFlickr site. Supports MacOS and Windows.

[Proxy Manager](https://github.com/gri-gus/proxymanager-streamdeck-plugin) - Plugin for enabling and disabling
proxies on MacOS. Periodically polls the proxy status through a separate thread.

[One-time password](https://github.com/gri-gus/otp-streamdeck-plugin) - Plugin for generating one-time passwords,
like in Google Authenticator. Has several Actions. Supports MacOS and Windows.
