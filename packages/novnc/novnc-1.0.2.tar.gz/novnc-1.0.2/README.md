# noVNC

noVNC is a Python-based server that comes with included **(websockify and noVNC)** that utilizes noVNC and websockify to provide a web-based VNC client. This allows users to remotely access and control a desktop environment through their web browser.

## Features

* **Easy Setup** : Quickly integrate your VNC server and access it via a web browser.
* **Web-based Access** : No need for a standalone VNC client; everything runs in the browser.
* **Secure Connection** : Uses websockify to securely proxy WebSocket connections to the VNC server.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* VNC server (e.g., TigerVNC, TightVNC)

## Installation

Install via pip:

```
pip install novnc
```

Manual Installation:

To install Terminal Widgets locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. `git clone https://github.com/imegeek/noVNC`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory. `cd noVNC`
3. Install the package using pip: `pip install .` or `pip3 install .`

This will install noVNC along with its dependencies from the local source files.

## Options

* `--listen HOST:PORT`: Sets the proxy/webserver IP address and port to listen. Default is `http://[::]:5800`.
* `--target HOST:PORT`: Sets the VNC IP address and port to target.

## Usage

Start the server by running the module:

```
novnc --listen <HOST:PORT> --target <VNC_SERVER_IP>:<VNC_SERVER_PORT> 
```

## Example

```
novnc --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 --target 127.0.0.1:5900
```

Now server will listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` and targets the VNC server at `127.0.0.1:5900`.

## Configuration

To customize the program's behavior, you can use the --listen and --target options when running the executable.

## Troubleshooting

* **Connection Issues** : Ensure the VNC server is running and accessible. Verify the IP and port.
