class OneDTreeGenerator():
	"""
	Computes the (1D) distance before the next tree impact from the trees/rock properties and a probability law. Instanciate then launch :meth:`getOneRandomTreeImpactDistance` to get the next distance.
	
	Note:
		The probability is constructed as follows. Trees are seen as layers of trees, randomly shifted at each layer but spaced regularly by a distance :math:`l` to satisfy the trees density. We compute :math:`q`, the probability to pass through one layer, which in turns gives the impact CDF as a function of the distance travelled by the rock :math:`x` : :math:`CDF(x)=1-q^{x/l}`. By defnition, the PDF is finally the derivative function of the CDF.
	
	Attributes:
		sim (:class:`~Common.Simulations.GenericSimulation`, optional): the parent simulation
		treesDensity (float): the trees density, in trees/mÂ²
		trees_dhp (float, optional): the trees mean diameter, in meters
		dRock (float, optional): the rock equivalent diameter, in meters
		l (float): the computed virtual distance between two trees
		q (float): the probability to pass through 1 screen of trees without impact, i.e. to travel through :attr:`l` distance without impact
		prob0 (float): the probability to hit a tree immediately
		random_generator (): copied from simulation or :class:`numpy.random`
