Clause 7.2 says that a request must consist of a single RequestValue
It doesn't say what other fields may be present e.g. startTime or endTime
Should they be honoured if they are?

More general issue with where to send the results (i.e. a destination 
should be specified as part of the Request). Could be nailed down to
only containing a URL or FQDN?

Choice on responding to failures with ActionError or with a LD status of invalid
(as usual) with appropriate info?

Are there any restrictions on how many requests can be put in a single message?

Do we intend for people to use the Workflow Profiles for this?

For consistency with workflows, the LDDesiredStatus of the request should be AwaitingDisclosure

If we allow querying of the LDTaskObjects afterwards, we should say that the
status post-disclosure is "Disclosed".

Conflict between LDTaskStatus "DisclosureNotAvailable" and "Disclosed" with zero recorss
(which appears to be what 103 976 expects)
