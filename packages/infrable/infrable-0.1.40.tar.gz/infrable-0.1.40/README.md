## Prologue

In an infinite void surrounded by blinking lights, Hanny woke up with her memory hollow,
only her name echoing in the dark corners of her mind. She found herself floating in a
realm between the tangible world of **Python** code and the ethereal cosmos of the space. A
synthetic voice resonated around her about a crucial **infrastructure** migration project
but it was all Greek to her. Her memory, once the key to the Python kingdom, failed to
provide any answers. She was stuck in an interstellar labyrinth, entrusted with a
technology mission she could not recall, her only anchors being a mechanical keyboard and
lines of code whizzing past on the nearby screen.

## Chapter 1 - Chaos

In the void of her discontent, Hanny started to recall fragments of a past life: back on
Earth, where a looming infrastructure migration project threatened to upend everything.
Humanity grappled with a **chaotic infrastructure** and an **ill-prepared toolkit**. Python
developers fought with convoluted tools, while the desperate search for **declarative
configuration management** proved futile. Amidst this disarray, Hanny was catapulted into
the cosmos, a reluctant knight tasked with an unenviable quest: to find an
**uncomplicated yet competent solution** capable of taming this looming catastrophe.

## Chapter 2 - Hosts and Services

In a moment of revelation, Hanny grasped the intricacies of infrastructure: **hosts and the
services** they housed, the vital backbone of any system. She understood the criticality of
maintaining **a single reference source, a complete, harmonious documentation capturing
these elemental relationships**. Committing herself to uphold this single source of truth
principle, she began the painstaking process of documentation, pouring every detail into
a consolidated testament christened **"infra.py"**.

**infra.py**

```python
from infrable import Host, Service

# Hosts/ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
dev_host = Host(fqdn="dev.example.com", ip="127.0.0.1")
beta_host = Host(fqdn="beta.example.com", ip="127.0.0.1")
prod_host = Host(fqdn="prod.example.com", ip="127.0.0.1")
# /Hosts -----------------------------------------------------------------------


# Services/ --------------------------------------------------------------------
dev_web = Service(host=dev_host, port=8080)
beta_web = Service(host=beta_host, port=8080)
prod_web = Service(host=prod_host, port=8080)

dev_nginx = Service(host=dev_host, port=80)
beta_nginx = Service(host=beta_host, port=80)
prod_nginx = Service(host=prod_host, port=80)
# /Services --------------------------------------------------------------------
```

List the hosts and services:

```bash
infrable hosts
infrable services
```

## Chapter 3 - Templates

Gradually piecing together her fragmented memories, Hanny realized configuration files
for the host deployments ought to be maintained as **templates, drawing values as
needed from "infra.py"**. Back on Earth, the challenge had been a lack of a coherent
system to document the destination of these files, a problem of organization that posed a
significant hurdle. Then, in a moment of genius, Hanny conceived a groundbreaking
solution. She'd document the files' path directly within the configuration templates
themselves. And so, with renewed vigor, she started adding crucial details as **header
comments nestled within the configuration files**, a legendary stroke promising to
transform the face of infrastructure migration.

**infra.py**

```python
template_prefix = "https://github.com/username/repository/blob/main"
```

**templates/nginx/web.j2**

```nginx
# vim: syn=nginx

# ---
# src: {{ template_prefix }}/{{ _template.src }}
# dest: {{ dev_nginx.host }}:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/web
# chmod: 644
# chown: root:root
# ---

server {
    listen {{ dev_nginx.port }};
    listen [::]:{{ dev_nginx.port }}

    server_name {{ dev_nginx.host.fqdn }} www.{{ dev_nginx.host.fqdn }};

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:{{ dev_web.port }};
        include proxy_params;
    }
}
```

NOTE: The `_template.src` is a special variable, available in all templates.

## Chapter 4 - The Deploy or Recover Workflow

In the vast expanse of uncertainty, one thing became crystal clear to Hanny: the
importance of **reviewing the files made through "infra.py" and comparing these with the
currently deployed configurations before pushing them**. This process would intercept
any **live changes** and ensure their inclusion in the templates. Her cautious nature also
recognized the essential function of maintaining **local backups** of the utilized
configurations, providing an insurance of sorts. To address any complications, she
conceived a failsafe measure: **The Deploy or Recover Workflow**. It promised relief from
human error while ensuring an approach to **easily revert and recover** the service,
another triumphant stride in Hanny’s cosmic saga.

Deploy workflow:

```bash
infrable files deploy [path]

## Same as
# infrable files gen [path]
# infrable files pull
# infrable files backup
# infrable files push
```

For snake folks:

```python
from infrable import files

files.deploy(path)

## Same as
# files.gen(path)
# files.pull()
# files.backup()
# files.push()
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[gen: generate artifacts from templates and infra.py as .new files] --> B[pull: for each generated artifact pull the currently deployed version from server as .old files];
    B --> C[backup: copy the artifacts in a local backup directory for easy recovery in case of failure];
    C --> E[diff: compare the .new and .old files];
    E -- push: for each result --> F{is there any difference?};
    F -- yes --> H[display the diff];
    F -- no --> G[skip and delete artifacts];
    H --> I{confirm push?};
    I -- yes --> J[push the file onto the server];
    I -- no --> K[skip and delete artifacts];
```

Diff example:

```diff
--- .infrable/files/root@dev.example.com/etc/monit/conf.d/system.cfg.old

+++ .infrable/files/root@dev.example.com/etc/monit/conf.d/system.cfg.new

Recover workflow:

```bash

```

## Chapter 5 - Commands, Tasks and Workflows

As Hanny delved deeper into the complexities of infrastructure migration, she encountered
a critical realization: the need to extend beyond mere configuration pushing. To attain a
seamless transition, testing, service restarts, and other post-deployment actions were
imperative. With relentless determination, she integrated a feature within "infra.py" to
**execute remote commands** on hosts, a capability enhancing the deployment process.

```bash
# Run a command on a host by name
infrable remote dev_host "sudo systemctl reload nginx"

# Or by service name
infrable remote dev_nginx "sudo systemctl reload nginx"

# Or all affected hosts (as per files diff)
infrable remote affected-hosts "sudo systemctl reload nginx"

# Or
infrable files affected-hosts | infrable remote - "sudo systemctl reload nginx"
```

But Hanny's pursuit of excellence didn't halt there; she grasped the inadequacy of loose
command execution, acknowledging the necessity for structured organization. Thus, she
envisioned a novel concept - the creation of **"Tasks"**, groups of related commands
designed to streamline operations.

**infra.py**

```python
import typer

# Tasks/ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
dev_nginx.typer = typer.Typer(help="dev_nginx specific tasks.")

@dev_nginx.typer.command(name="reload")
def reload_dev_nginx():
    """[TASK] Reload nginx: infrable dev-nginx reload"""

    assert dev_nginx.host, "Service must have a host to reload"
    dev_nginx.host.remote().sudo.nginx("-t")
    dev_nginx.host.remote().sudo.systemctl.reload.nginx()
# /Tasks -----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Running tasks:

```bash
infrable dev-nginx reload
```

As she toiled to realize this vision, a brilliant idea swept over her - to
orchestrate these tasks into coherent sequences, she christened them
**"workflows"**, heralding the dawn of a new era in infrastructure management.

**infra.py**

```python
from infrable import concurrent, paths

# Workflows/ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
deploy = typer.Typer(help="Deployment workflows.")

@deploy.command(name="dev-nginx")
def deploy_dev_nginx():
    """[WORKFLOW] Deploy dev_nginx files: infrable deploy dev-nginx"""

    files.deploy(paths.templates / "nginx")
    cmd = "sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx && echo success || echo failed"
    fn = lambda host: (host, host.remote().sudo(cmd))
    for host, result in concurrent(fn, files.affected_hosts()):
        print(f"{host}: {result}")
# /Workflows -----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Running workflows:

```bash
infrable deploy dev-nginx
```

## Chapter 6 - Environments and Switches

The exhilaration of progress was swiftly countered by the rigors of defining **templates,
tasks, and workflows independently for every host within multiple environments**. Hanny's
keen eyes blinked tiredly at lines of Python code, her fingers aching from relentless
typing. It was then that she stumbled upon another vital realization: **the service and
host relationship hinged upon the environment**. The environment — "dev", "beta", "prod",
among others — determined where services were deployed. Wondering **if environments could
be switchable**, she pondered a pivotal question: What if the "infra.py" file could
adjust values based on the environment? This would phenomenally simplify the deployment
process, **utilizing the same template, task, and workflow definitions across different
hosts**. Seizing on this insight, Hanny developed **'Switch'**, an ingenious mechanism
allowing **environment-dependent value adjustment within "infra.py"**. With 'Switch',
infrastructure migration wasn't a labyrinth to navigate but a journey of exploration and
innovation. The weight of her mission lightened with every line of code she churned out.
And so Hanny, engulfed by the silence of the cosmos, marched on, her spirit indomitable,
her zeal untamed.

**infra.py**

```python
from infrable import Switch, Host, Service

# Environments/ ----------------------------------------------------------------
dev = "dev"
beta = "beta"
prod = "prod"

environments = {dev, beta, prod}
env = Switch(environments, init=dev)  # <-- Defining a switch for different environments
current_env = env()
# /Environments ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Hosts/ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
dev_host = Host(fqdn="dev.example.com", ip="127.0.0.1")
beta_host = Host(fqdn="beta.example.com", ip="127.0.0.2")
prod_host = Host(fqdn="prod.example.com", ip="127.0.0.3")

managed_hosts = env(  # <-- Switching hosts based on the environment
    dev=[dev_host],
    beta=[beta_host],
    prod=[prod_host],
)
# /Hosts -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Services/ --------------------------------------------------------------------
web = Service(
    host=env.strict(dev=dev_host, beta=beta_host, prod=prod_host),  # <-- Strict switch
    port=8080,
)

nginx = Service(port=80, host=web.host)  # <-- No need to use switch here
# /Services --------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Updating the templates to use the switchable values:

**templates/nginx/proxy_params.j2**

```nginx
# vim: syn=nginx

# ---
# src: {{ template_prefix }}/{{ _template.src }}
# dest:
# {% for host in managed_hosts %}  # <-- Yes, you can
#   - loc: {{ host }}:/etc/nginx/proxy_params
# {% endfor %}
# chmod: 644
# chown: root:root
# ---
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

Managing switches:

```bash
# Switch current environment
infrable switch env [dev|beta|prod]

# Check the current switch value
infrable switch env

# See other options for the switch
infrable switch env --options

# If you name a switch "env", you get an alias for convenience
infrable env [dev|beta|prod]

# Check all switch values
infrable switches
```

## Chapter 7 - Meta and Secrets

A veil of mystery cloaked Hanny's latest quest. She coveted the ability to access **secret
values, untouched by the eyes of version control systems, and juxtapose these to hosts
and services**. It was a daunting challenge — to embed securely these secret keys within
the Python labyrinth without heightening complexity. She mused, her gaze focused on the
stars scattered across the cosmos. If simplicity was the mother of invention, Hanny would
be its devoted disciple. She engaged in the great **Pythonic tradition of simplicity**,
armed with wisdom acquired from prior challenges, plunging into the task at hand. She
devised an elegant strategy. Her solution was a poet’s dream and a programmer’s delight,
the relief of her achievement echoing in the cosmic silence.

**infra.py**

```python
from infrable import Meta, readfile

common_secret_key = readfile("secrets/common/secret_key")  # <-- Read a secret file

web = Service(
    meta=Meta(secret_key=common_secret_key),  # <-- Attach metadata to items
    host=env(dev=dev_host, beta=beta_host, prod=prod_host),
    port=8080,
)
```

Managing secrets:

```bash
# Hide secrets from git
echo /secrets/ >> .gitignore

# Update the secrets by hand
vim secrets/common/secret_key
```

## Chapter 8 - Custom Modules

As the celestial silence enveloped her, Hanny stared at the last line of code and
finally, exhaled. The Python maestro had defied the odds, charting a path through the
sprawling galaxy of infrastructure migration. In her hands, humanity held the weapon to
combat the specter of inevitable infrastructure displacement, not just once but
potentially countless times henceforth. No longer would they flounder in the face of
migration, for **'infrable'** was here.

But if the endless cosmos stood as a testament to anything, it was the **limitless
potential for growth**. Hanny, ever the visionary, saw beyond the painstaking creation of
a toolkit. She envisioned a continuously evolving mechanism, a collaborative system
enhanced by the collective genius of Python peers worldwide. That's when it struck her.
Like a supernova in the silent night, she realized the adaptability imbued within Python.
Fellow programmers could craft **Python modules** and stitch them into the existing
"infra.py", thus **extending and elevating its functionality**, a synergy of skills and
codes enhancing 'infrable' to uncharted territories.

**modules/mycloud.py**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typer import Typer
from infrable import Host, infra

@dataclass
class MyCloud:
    """MyCloud Python library."""

    secret_api_key: str
    typer: Typer | None = None

    def provision_ubuntu_host(self, fqdn: str):
        ip = self.api.create_ubuntu_host(fqdn)
        return MyCloudUbuntuHost(fqdn=fqdn, ip=ip)

@dataclass
class MyCloudUbuntuHost(Host):
    """MyCloud's customized Ubuntu server."""

    def setup(self):
        self.install_mycloud_agent()

    def install_mycloud_agent(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

workflows = Typer()

@workflows.command()
def provision_ubuntu_host(fqdn: str, setup: bool = True):
    """[WORKFLOW] Provision Ubuntu host."""

    # Get the MyCloud instance from infra.py
    cloud = next(iter(infra.item_types[MyCloud].values()))

    # Provision the host
    host = cloud.provision_ubuntu_host(fqdn)
    if setup:
        host.setup()

    name = fqdn.split(".")[0].replace("-", "_")
    print("Add the host to the infra.py file.")
    print(f"{name} = {repr(host}")
```

Plugging the module in infra.py:

**infra.py**

```python
from modules import mycloud

# Clouds/ ----------------------------------------------------------------------
cloud = mycloud.MyCloud(secret_api_key=readfile("secrets/mycloud/secret_api_key"))
cloud.typer = mycloud.workflows
# /Clouds ----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Running the module workflows:

```bash
infra cloud --help
```
