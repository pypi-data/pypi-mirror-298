It provides the loss function and callbacks to apply to keras models


## Usage

To use Alquitable, follow these steps:

```bash
    pip install alquitable
```

Since Aquitable is based on keras-core you can choose which backend to use, otherwise it will default to tensorflow.
To change backend change the ```KERAS-BACKEND``` enviromental variable. Follow [this](https://keras.io/keras/#configuring-your-backend).

To get an arquiteture you only need to have a simple configuration and call the module:

```python
# Previous code and imports
...
from alquitable import losses, callbacks

# Based on forecat StackedCNN


loss_funtion=losses.weighted_loss
callback = callbacks.StopOnNanLoss

StackedCNN.compile(loss=loss_funtion)

StackedCNN.fit(
    ...
    callbacks=callback
)


```
