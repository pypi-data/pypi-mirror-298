Python client for GoldLink.

The library is currently tested against Python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

## Installation

The `goldlink-client-python` package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/goldlink-client-python). Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install goldlink-client-python
```

## Getting Started

The `Client` object can be created with different levels of authentication depending on which features are needed. For more complete examples, see the [examples](./examples/) directory, as well as [the integration tests](./integration_tests/).

Both examples and integratio tests assume a local environment with GoldLink contracts have been deployed as described [here](https://github.com/GoldLink-Protocol/goldlink-contracts).
