        """Return a pytensor operator that solves the system of differential equations.

        Same as get_func, but returns a pytensor operator that can be used in a pymc
        model. Beware that for this operator the output of the integration of the ODE
        can only be a single or a list variables. If the output is a dict,
        set list_keys_to_return to specify the keys of the variables that are
        returned by the integrator. These return values aren't allowed to be further
        nested.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ODE : function(t, y, args)
            A function that returns the derivatives of the variables of the system of
            differential equations. The function has to take as input the time `t`, the
            variables `y` and the arguments `args=(arg_t, constant_args)` of the system
            of differential equations. `t` is a float, `y` is a list or dict of
            floats or ndarrays, or in general, a pytree, see :mod:`jax.tree_util` for
            more details. The return value of the function has to be a
            pytree/list/dict with the same structure as `y`.
        return_shapes : tuple of tuples, default is ((),)
            Depreceated, the return shape had to be specified before, now it is inferred
            automatically. This argument isn't used anymore.
        list_keys_to_return : list of str or None, default is None
            The keys of the variables of the system of differential equations that will
            be chosen to be returned by the integrator.
            If `None`, the output is returned as is.
        name :
            The name under which the operator is registered in pymc.

        Returns
        -------
        pytensor_op : :class:`pytensor.graph.op.Op`
            A :mod:`pytensor` operator that can be used in a :class:`pymc.Model`.
