#### Features and plans

- [x] Auto-wrapping everything inside module with `nip`
- [x] List node as an iterable node (currently only simple python-lists are supported for iterators)
- [x] python code inserts with in-scope
- [x] fstrings
- [X] strict: check typing and reloading dict keys
- [x] `run` function
- [x] object dumping
- [ ] Multiline strings with """ operator (questionable)
- [ ] \_\_init\_\_ wrapper for convenient object dumping (currently only config dumping. questionable)
