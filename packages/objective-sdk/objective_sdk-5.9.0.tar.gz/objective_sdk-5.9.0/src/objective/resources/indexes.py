        ## Index configuration

        ### Index types

        Indexes have an index type that determines how the data inserted is processed.

        We currently support 5 Index types:

        1. text - semantically search text through the optimized combination of
           lexical/keyword and neural search capabilities that leverage state-of-the-art
           embeddings.
        2. multimodal - combines lexical/keyword search and neural search for both text
           and image data. Enables searching over text and images with both keyword
           precision and semantic understanding.
        3. image - semantically search images with text using image embeddings for
           search.
        4. text-neural - semantically search text content using state of the art text
           embeddings for search.
        5. multimodal-neural - semantically search text AND image content using
           multimodal embeddings for search.

        ### Indexing fields from Objects

        Indexes support configuring how fields in Objects that are indexed are
        processed. The following configurations are supported at a field level:

        1. Crawlable - fields which will be crawled and made available for search. Read
           more about [crawling](/apis/ingestion/crawling).
        2. Searchable - fields which will contribute to search relevance.
        3. Filterable - fields which may be filtered upon. Read more about
           [filtering](/apis/search/overview#filtering-search-results).
        4. Types - A mapping of fields to data types for filterable fields. By default
           all filterable fields are considered strings, unless specified here. For more
           info on supported types see
           [field types](/apis/search/filtering#field-types).

        **Defaults:**

        1. Crawlable - no fields are crawled
        2. Filterable - no fields are filterable

        ### Finetuning

        Indexes can learn from your feedback, training your index to retrieve more
        relevant results that better match your unique business needs. To configure
        `finetuning` set your base index using `base_index_id` and provide `feedback` in
        the form of `query`, `object_id`, and `label`. Check out the Quickstart guide to
        get started.

        Acceptable labels are:

        - **GREAT**: For objects that you want to encourage retrieving for the specified
          query.
        - **OK**: For objects that have a loose connection to the query but you do not
          want to reward.
        - **BAD**: For objects that you want to discourage retrieving for the specified
          query.

        Constraints:

        - You must include at least 50 queries
        - Each query must have at least one object with a “GREAT” label and one object
          with a “BAD” label.
