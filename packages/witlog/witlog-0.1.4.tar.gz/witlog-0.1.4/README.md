## Features

- üéà Lightweight: No heavy dependencies, plug and play!
- üéØ Zero-overhead: No overhead if you turn it off!
- üë®‚Äçüéì Structured: Use output format **defined by you**. You master every detail!
- üîß Flexible and easy for use. Just `logger.log("witness", variables)`! Witlog will automatically organize them.

## Installation

Simply `pip install witlog`

If you want to support your machine learning project, try `pip install witlog[full]`. Full version would introduce a lot of "heavy" dependencies. 

## Usage

### Quick Start

```py
import witlog as wl
from witlog import StaticLogger

logger = StaticLogger([
            "layer_idx",
            ["x","y"] * 5,
            "post_scores",
            ...
        ], print)#print for example
wl.register_logger('CHECK_SCORES', logger)

... ##your code

with wl.monitor('CHECK_SCORES') as logger:
    logger.log('layer_idx', layer)

for i in range(5):
    ##do sth
    with wl.monitor('CHECK_SCORES') as logger:
        logger.log('x', x)
        logger.log('y', y)
with wl.monitor('CHECK_SCORES') as logger:
    logger.log('post_scores', post_scores)
```

This example code would print all variables, because `print` is passed as `output_func`.

Let's have a quick view of the signature of `StaticLogger`:

```py
class StaticLogger:
    def __init__(self, template, output_func):
        ...
```

`template` is a list, the format will be elaborated later. `output_func` is a callable which will receive a `LogBlock`(your logging result) object. We also offer a `PickleTo` helper class for better saving. You can access it by `wl.PickleTo`.

The overall workflow is:

1. define your logging format.
2. define your output_func.
3. register logger.
4. Insert `monitor` and `logger.log` into your code to inspect what is happening. 

Monitor will return a default logger if no logger is registered. And this logger will do nothing.

If you want to disable a logger, it's quite easy: `wl.remove_logger(name)`.

WitLog is designed for **inspect existing code**, not intended for production-level real-time logging. This narrows the scope of application of Witlog, but makes it a sharp knife in the research field.

### Logging

#### Main Concepts

Witlog considers code as many loops(including nested loop), and hence logs can be structured as *blocks*. Each block corresponds to a loop in code.

So, the code below

```py
print(x)
for i in range(K):
    print(y)

print(z)
```

can be seen as :

```py
[
    item,
    block,
    item
]
```

Naturally, we can come up with such a definition:

1. The log message unit is *Message*. A message is indivisible.
2. Each *Block* consists of **ordered** Message and Block.
3. A Message is a Block.

Hence, we can define log format as a list:

```py
[
    "name1",
    ["a", "b"] * m,
    "samples"...
]
```

Since python code is executed orderedly, logging when running has same order as traversing this list. Thus, we can get a well-structured log. 

This has an advantage when use: you ONLY need to specify the `name` when logging, ignoring the actual tree-like structure. It's very convenient like:

```py
with wl.monitor("SCORES") as logger:
    logger.log('a', a)
```

This means you don't need to care about other code affect when developing.

In implementation, *Block* is corresponding to `LogBlock`, *Message* is corresponding to `LogMsg`. Both have a property `content`, including the actual object(s) they store. `LogMsg` has a `name` but `LogBlock` is anonymous.

#### Post-processing

Witlog's biggest advantage lies in its simple post-processing. You can easily extract the data you need from the structured `LogBlock`, rather than manually writing cumbersome analysis scripts.

Say you've got a `LogBlock` defined by:

```py
[
    'outer_loop_idx',
    ['inner_x'] * 10,
    'final_flag'
]
```

and you want extract 5th `inner_x`:

```py
print(block[1][4].content)
```

If you want to get the content associating to a *unique* name, such as `final_flag`, it's easier and more readable:

```py
print(block['final_flag'].content)
```

But if you want to extract content associating to duplicate names, the default indexing would only return the first match. This is not recommended.

### Timing

Now `witlog.timing`(shorthand as `wt`) provides two approaches to measure time and organize them:

1. Use decorator `@wt.timethis(name)` on definition of functions. We recommend writing it as the outermost decorator. 
2. Use contextmanger `@wt.timing(name)`. 

All records will be aggregated into a list `records`. You can access it by `wt.get_records()`. This function would return a list of `(name, duration)`, sorted by end timing. 

The advantages of the timing module compared to cprofiler are:

1. It can easily attach hook functions. See `wt.set_config(config)`.
2. It takes CUDA synchronization into account(requires installation of full version).
3. It allows assigning different names to the same function call, thus distinguishing between them.

This last point is particularly useful when analyzing frequently called low-level modules, as these modules usually can't be made faster and can only be optimized in terms of access patterns. Distinguishing names helps you discover different access patterns.

### FAQ

- Q: I just want to log when something is wrong. So it's not a perfect static loop. How should I handle this?
  - A: Divide your logger to serval small loggers. Ensure for each small logger, they are handling static loops. Worth noting, a trivial logger `logger = StaticLogger(['single'])` can handle any logging pattern of `single`, because it outputs **immediately** after receiving one logging message. So in theory, you can use many loggers for any patterns. In practice, you need to balance the coding effort and logging pattern.

### Convention

1. No expression in `log(key, value)`. Expressions would be always executed(even if you remove the register), and that might cause unexpected overhead. The best practice is simple string for key and only object for value. A common mistake is f-string. If you really want to combine something, we recommend you to implement a custom logger.
2. Use `with wl.monitor(name)` instead of `get_logger`. The latter one would work and reduce some coding effort indeed, but `with` create a block of code. It's more readable, and allowing "truly zero-overhead". Though skipping `with` is rejected in [PEP-343](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/), there is will some space for hacking code stack. It's dangerous so will not be integrated into witlog, but maybe we can achieve this safely some day üòâ
