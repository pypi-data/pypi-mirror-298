# colorevo

A Graphical User Interface to register color changes in regions of interest (ROI) of a video source.

The data source can either be a pre-recorded video file or a live stream from an attached camera. The user can interactively define any number of ROIs of arbitrary shapes for which the evolution of their average [Hue, Saturation and Brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) values will be independently computed and plotted as a function of time. 

The data processing can take place *live* (i.e while the video is being acquired) and/or later on based on the saved video (which allows the user to re-analyze the same data with different ROIs, for example).

The code is Free Software under the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), and written in pure [Python](https://www.python.org/). It uses [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for accessing the video source. The Graphical user interface is based on [PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) and [PyqtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/). The video sources are internally converted and stored with [HDF5](https://www.h5py.org/) and processed with [numpy](https://numpy.org/).


## Installation

### With uv (recommended):

1. Install `uv` (follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
2. Use uv to install the latest stable release of colorevo (*):
    ```
    uv tool install -U colorevo
    ```
    > (*) **Tip:** to install the latest *development* version, replace the previous command by 
    > ```
    > uv tool install -U git+https://gitlab.com/c-p/colorevo.git@master
    > ``` 


### With pip
This is also a valid installation method, but you need to handle virtual environments manually:
1. Create a python virtual environment (e.g. with `conda`, or `pyhon -m venv` or ...) and activate it.
2. Run `pip install colorevo`

## Launching the GUI
Run: 
```
colorevo
```
