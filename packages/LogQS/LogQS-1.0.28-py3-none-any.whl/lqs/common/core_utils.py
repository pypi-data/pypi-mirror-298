        Upload a directory of files to a log.

        The files are uploaded as log objects, meaning they are associated with a single log given by log_id.
        The files are split into parts of size part_size, which are uploaded in parallel using a maximum of max_workers workers.
        If no part_size is provided, the part size will be determined based on the file size to try to optimize the upload.
        Note that larger values for part_size and max_workers will generally result in faster uploads, but may also result in higher memory usage and connection issues.

        If skip_if_exists is set to True, the upload will be skipped if the object already exists.
        If continue_upload is set to True, any existing parts of the object will be skipped and the upload will continue from where it left off.
        If continue_upload is set to True and skip_if_complete is set to True, the upload will be skipped if the object is already complete.
        If overwrite is set to True, any existing object with the same key will be deleted before the upload.
