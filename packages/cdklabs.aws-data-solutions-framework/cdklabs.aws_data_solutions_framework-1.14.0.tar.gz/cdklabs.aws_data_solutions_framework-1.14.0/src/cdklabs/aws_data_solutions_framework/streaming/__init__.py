# MSK Provisioned

An MSK Provisioned cluster with helpers to manage topics, ACLs and IAM permissions.

## Overview

The construct creates an MSK Provisioned Cluster, with the latest Kafka version in MSK as default. You can change the defaults by passing your own parameters as a Resource property to construct initializer. The construct supports creating clusters with mTLS, IAM or both as authentication methods. The construct use IAM as authentication by default if none is provided. It offers methods to manage topics and ACLs. Last, it also provides methods to grant an existing principal (ie IAM Role or IAM User or CN -Common Name-) with the permission to `produce` or `consume` to/from a kafka topic. The diagram below shows the high level architecture.

![MSK Provisioned High level architecture](../../../website/static/img/msk-provisioned.png)

The construct can create a VPC on your behalf that is used to deploy MSK Provisioned cluster or you can provide your own VPC definition through the `vpcConfigs` property when you initialize the construct. The VPC that is created on your behalf has `10.0.0.0/16` CIDR range, and comes with an S3 VPC Endpoint Gateway attached to it. The construct also creates a security group that is attached to the brokers.

### Construct cluster setup

The construct sets up a dedicated security group for Zookeeper as advised in the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/zookeeper-security.html#zookeeper-security-group). When authentication is set to TLS, the construct apply ACLs on the provided principal in the props defined as `certificateDefinition`. This principal is used by the custom resource to manage ACL. Last, the construct applies MSK configuration setting `allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found` to `false`. You can also provide your own MSK configuration, in this case the construct does not create one and will apply the one you passed as part of the props.

### Interacting with cluster

The construct has the following methods, you will usage examples in the new sections:

```
*  setTopic: Perform create, update, and delete operations on Topics
*  setACL: Perform create, update, and delete operations on ACL
*  grantProduce: Attach an IAM policy to a principal to write to a topic
*  grantConsume: Attach an IAM policy to a principal to read from a topic
```

Below you can find an example of creating an MSK Provisioned configuration with the default options.

```python
msk = MskProvisioned(stack, "cluster")
```

## Usage

### Bring Your Own VPC

The construct allows you to provide your own VPC that was created outside the CDK Stack. Below you will find an example usage.

```python
vpc = Vpc.from_vpc_attributes(stack, "vpc",
    vpc_id="vpc-1111111111",
    vpc_cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16",
    availability_zones=["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b"],
    public_subnet_ids=["subnet-111111111", "subnet-11111111"],
    private_subnet_ids=["subnet-11111111", "subnet-1111111"]
)

msk = MskProvisioned(stack, "cluster",
    vpc=vpc,
    cluster_name="my-cluster",
    subnets=vpc.select_subnets()
)
```

### Create a cluster with mTLS authentication

The construct allows you to create a cluster with mTLS, below is a code snippet showing the configuration.

When using MSK with mTLS the constructs requires a principal that is assigned to the custom resources that manage ACLs and Topics. The certificate and private key are expected to be in a secret managed by [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html). The secret needs to be in the format defined below and stored a `JSON Key/value` and not `Plaintext` in the Secret. The construct grants the lambda that supports the Custom Resource read access to the secret as an `Identity based policy`.

```json
    {
      key : "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----",

      cert : "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy -----END CERTIFICATE-----"
    }
```

```python
certificate_authority = CertificateAuthority.from_certificate_authority_arn(stack, "certificateAuthority", "arn:aws:acm-pca:eu-west-1:123456789012:certificate-authority/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-454a-cccc-b454877f0d1b")

msk = MskProvisioned(stack, "cluster",
    client_authentication=ClientAuthentication.sasl_tls(
        iam=True,
        certificate_authorities=[certificate_authority]
    ),
    certificate_definition=AclAdminProps(
        admin_principal="User:CN=Admin",
        acl_admin_principal="User:CN=aclAdmin",
        secret_certificate=Secret.from_secret_complete_arn(stack, "secret", "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:dsf/mskCert-3UhUJJ")
    ),
    allow_everyone_if_no_acl_found=False
)
```

### setTopic

This method allows you to create, update or delete an ACL. Its backend uses [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).
The topic is defined by the property type called `MskTopic`.
If your MSK cluster uses KRaft mode rather than ZooKeeper, we encourage you to set to the parameter `waitForLeaders = true`
and `timeout = 10000`.
Below you can see the definition of the topic as well as a usage.

```json
{
    topic: <String>,
    numPartitions: <Number>,     // default: -1 (uses broker `num.partitions` configuration)
    replicationFactor: <Number>, // default: -1 (uses broker `default.replication.factor` configuration)
    replicaAssignment: <Array>,  // Example: [{ partition: 0, replicas: [0,1,2] }] - default: []
    configEntries: <Array>       // Example: [{ name: 'cleanup.policy', value: 'compact' }] - default: []
}
```

Dependeding on the authentication type that is set in the cluster, you need to put the right parameter in authentication, for mTLS use `Authentitcation.MTLS` and for IAM use `Authentitcation.IAM`. The example below uses IAM as authentication.

```python
msk.set_topic("topic1", Authentication.IAM, MskTopic(
    topic="topic1",
    num_partitions=3,
    replication_factor=1,
    config_entries=[{
        "name": "retention.ms",
        "value": "90000"
    }, {
        "name": "retention.bytes",
        "value": "90000"
    }
    ]
), cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, False, 1500)
```

### setACL

This method allows you to create, update or delete a topic. Its backend uses [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).
The topic is defined by the property type called `MskACL`. This method should be used only when the cluster authentication is set to `mTLS`. Below you can see the definition of the topic as well as an example of use.

```json
{
    resourceType: <AclResourceTypes>,
    resourceName: <String>,
    resourcePatternType: <ResourcePatternTypes>,
    principal: <String>,
    host: <String>,
    operation: <AclOperationTypes>,
    permissionType: <AclPermissionTypes>,
}
```

You can authenticate to your cluster using IAM or mTLS to create ACLs. These ACLs will be used later by a client that will authenticate to your cluster using mTLS. Dependeding on the authentication type that you would like to use to create the ACL, you need to put the right parameter in `clientAuthentication`: for mTLS use `Authentitcation.MTLS` and for IAM use `Authentitcation.IAM`. Default value is `Authentitcation.MTLS`. The example below uses IAM as authentication.

```python
msk.set_acl("acl", Acl(
    resource_type=AclResourceTypes.TOPIC,
    resource_name="topic-1",
    resource_pattern_type=ResourcePatternTypes.LITERAL,
    principal="User:Cn=Bar",
    host="*",
    operation=AclOperationTypes.CREATE,
    permission_type=AclPermissionTypes.ALLOW
), cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, Authentication.IAM)
```

### grantProduce

This method allows to grant a `Principal` the rights to write to a kafka topic.
In case of IAM authentication the method attachs an IAM policy as defined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.html#iam-access-control-use-cases) scoped only to the topic provided. For mTLS authentication, the method apply an ACL for the provided `Common Name` that allows it to write to the topic.

```python
msk.grant_produce("consume", "foo", Authentication.MTLS, "User:Cn=MyUser")
```

### grantConsume

This method allows to grant a `Principal` the rights to read to a kafka topic.
In case of IAM authentication the method attachs an IAM policy as defined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.html#iam-access-control-use-cases) scoped only to the topic provided. For mTLS authentication, the method apply an ACL for the provided `Common Name` that allows it to read from the topic.

```python
msk.grant_consume("consume", "foo", Authentication.MTLS, "User:Cn=MyUser")
```

### addCluster Policy

This method allows you to add IAM resource policy to your MSK cluster. This method can enable you for example to setup cross account access for your Amazon MSK cluster.

```python
msk = MskProvisioned(stack, "cluster")

cluter_policy = PolicyDocument(
    statements=[
        PolicyStatement(
            actions=["kafka:CreateVpcConnection", "kafka:GetBootstrapBrokers", "kafka:DescribeClusterV2"
            ],
            resources=[msk.cluster.attr_arn],
            effect=Effect.ALLOW,
            principals=[ServicePrincipal("firehose.amazonaws.com")]
        )
    ]
)

msk.add_cluster_policy(cluter_policy, "cluterPolicy")
```

# MSK Serverless

An MSK Serverless cluster with helpers to manage topics and IAM permissions.

## Overview

The construct creates an MSK Serverless Cluster, with the latest Kafka version in MSK as default. You can change the dafaults by passing your own parameters as a Resource property to construct initializer. There is also a method to create topics. Last, it also provides methods to grant an existing principal (ie IAM Role or IAM User) with the permission to `produce` or `consume` from a kafka topic. The diagram below shows the high level architecture.

![MSK Serverless High level architecture](../../../website/static/img/msk-serverless.png)

The construct can create a VPC on your behalf that is used to deploy MSK Serverless cluser or you can provide your own VPC definition through the `vpcConfigs` property when you initialize the construct. The VPC that is created on your behalf has `10.0.0.0/16` CIDR range, and comes with an S3 VPC Endpoint Gateway attached to it. The construct also creates a security group for that is attached to the brokers.

The construct has the following interfaces, you will usage examples in the new sections:
*  setTopic: Perform create, update, and delete operations on Topics
*  grantProduce: Attach an IAM policy to a principal to write to a topic
*  grantConsume: Attach an IAM policy to a principal to read from a topic

Below you can find an example of creating an MSK Serverless configuration with the default options.

### setTopic

This method allows you to create, update or delete a topic. Its backend uses [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).
The topic is defined by the property type called `MskTopic`.
If your MSK cluster uses KRaft mode rather than ZooKeeper, we encourage you to set to the parameter `waitForLeaders = true`
and `timeout = 10000`.
Below you can see the definition of the topic as well as a usage.

    }
    ]
)

msk.add_topic("topic1", topic, cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, False, 1500)
```

### grantProduce

This method allows to grant a `Principal` the rights to write to a kafka topic.
The method attachs an IAM policy as defined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.html#iam-access-control-use-cases) scoped only to the topic provided.

        )
    ]
)

msk.add_cluster_policy(cluter_policy, "cluterPolicy")
```

# Kafka Api - Bring your own cluster

Standalone access to Kafka data plane API to perform Create/Update/Delete operations for ACLs and Topics. The constructs support both MSK Serverless and MSK Provisioned, and is used when you need to bring your own cluster.

## Overview

The construct leverages the [CDK Provider Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.custom_resources-readme.html#provider-framework) to deploy a custom resource to manage `topics`, and in case of `mTLS` authentication deploys also a custom resource to manage `ACLs`.

```python
certificate_authority = CertificateAuthority.from_certificate_authority_arn(stack, "certificateAuthority", "arn:aws:acm-pca:eu-west-1:12345678912:certificate-authority/dummy-ca")

secret = Secret.from_secret_complete_arn(stack, "secret", "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:12345678912:secret:dsf/mskCert-dummy")

vpc = Vpc.from_vpc_attributes(stack, "vpc",
    vpc_id="vpc-1111111111",
    vpc_cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16",
    availability_zones=["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b"],
    public_subnet_ids=["subnet-111111111", "subnet-11111111"],
    private_subnet_ids=["subnet-11111111", "subnet-1111111"]
)

kafka_api = KafkaApi(stack, "kafkaApi",
    vpc=vpc,
    cluster_arn="arn:aws:kafka:eu-west-1:12345678912:cluster/byo-msk/dummy-5cf3-42d5-aece-dummmy-2",
    cluster_type=MskClusterType.PROVISIONED,
    broker_security_group=SecurityGroup.from_security_group_id(stack, "brokerSecurityGroup", "sg-98237412hsa"),
    certficate_secret=secret,
    client_authentication=ClientAuthentication.sasl_tls(
        iam=True,
        certificate_authorities=[certificate_authority]
    ),
    kafka_client_log_level=KafkaClientLogLevel.DEBUG,
    service_token="arn:aws:lambda::XXXXXX:function:XXXXXX-kafkaApiMskIamProviderCustomResour-XXXXXX"
)
```

When deploying multiple stacks with the Kafka Api, if there is an already existing service token deployed for the custom resource, you can reuse it to reduce the number of resources created like lambdas and ENI that are used to create and manage the lifecycle the custom resources, like ACLs and Topics.

:::warning

The construct needs to be deployed in the same region as the MSK cluster.

:::

## Using mTLS authentication

When using MSK with mTLS the constructs requires a principal that is assigned to the custom resources that manage ACLs and Topics. The certificate and private key are expected to be in a secret managed by [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html). The secret needs to be in the format defined below and stored a `JSON Key/value` and not `Plaintext` in the Secret. The construct grants the lambda that supports the Custom Resource read access to the secret as an `Identity based policy`.

```json
    {
      key : "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----",

      cert : "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy -----END CERTIFICATE-----"
    }
```

You can create the secret with the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name my-secret \
    --secret-string '{"key": "PRIVATE-KEY", "cert": "CERTIFICATE"}'
```

:::danger

Do not create the secret as part of the CDK application. The secret contains the private key and the deployment is not secured.

:::

You can use this [utility](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-msk-client-authentication) to generate the certificates:

1. Build the tool
2. Run the following command to generate the certificates and print them

```bash
java -jar AuthMSK-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -caa <PCA_ARN> -ccf tmp/client_cert.pem -pem -pkf tmp/private_key.pem -ksp "XXXXXXXXXX" -ksl tmp/kafka.client.keystore.jks
cat tmp/client_cert.pem
cat tmp/private_key.pem
```

1. Copy/paste the value of the client certificate and the private key in the secret

### setTopic

This method allows you to create, update or delete a topic. Its backend uses [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).
The topic is defined by the property type called `MskTopic`. Below you can see the definition of the topic.

```json
{
    topic: <String>,
    numPartitions: <Number>,     // default: -1 (uses broker `num.partitions` configuration)
    replicationFactor: <Number>, // default: -1 (uses broker `default.replication.factor` configuration)
    configEntries: <Array>       // Example: [{ name: 'cleanup.policy', value: 'compact' }] - default: []
}
```

Dependeding on the authentication type used in the cluster, you need to put the right parameter in authentication, for mTLS use `Authentitcation.MTLS` and for IAM use `Authentitcation.IAM`. The example below uses IAM as authentication.

```python
kafka_api.set_topic("topic1", Authentication.IAM, MskTopic(
    topic="topic1",
    num_partitions=3,
    replication_factor=1
), cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, False, 1500)
```

:::warning

Only the number of partitions can be updated after the creation of the topic.

:::

### setACL

This method allows you to create, update or delete an ACL. Its backend uses [kafkajs](https://kafka.js.org/).
The topic is defined by the property type called `MskACL`. This method can be used when the cluster authentication is set to `mTLS` or `IAM`+`mTLS`. Below you can see the definition of the ACL as well as an example of use.

```json
{
    resourceType: <AclResourceTypes>,
    resourceName: <String>,
    resourcePatternType: <ResourcePatternTypes>,
    principal: <String>,
    host: <String>,
    operation: <AclOperationTypes>,
    permissionType: <AclPermissionTypes>,
}
```

You can authenticate to your cluster using IAM or mTLS to create ACLs. These ACLs will be used later by a client that will authenticate to your cluster using mTLS. Dependeding on the authentication type that you would like to use to create the ACL, you need to put the right parameter in `clientAuthentication`: for mTLS use `Authentitcation.MTLS` and for IAM use `Authentitcation.IAM`. Default value is `Authentitcation.MTLS`. The example below uses mTLS as authentication.

```python
kafka_api.set_acl("acl", Acl(
    resource_type=AclResourceTypes.TOPIC,
    resource_name="topic-1",
    resource_pattern_type=ResourcePatternTypes.LITERAL,
    principal="User:Cn=MyUser",
    host="*",
    operation=AclOperationTypes.CREATE,
    permission_type=AclPermissionTypes.ALLOW
), cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, Authentication.MTLS)
```

### grantProduce

This method allows to grant a `Principal` the permissions to write to a kafka topic.
In case of IAM authentication the method attaches an IAM policy as defined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.html#iam-access-control-use-cases) scoped only to the topic provided. For mTLS authentication, the method applies an ACL for the provided `Common Name` that allow write operations on the topic.

```python
kafka_api.grant_produce("consume", "foo", Authentication.MTLS, "User:Cn=bar")
```

### grantConsume

This method allows to grant a `Principal` the permissions to read to a kafka topic.
In case of IAM authentication the method attachs an IAM policy as defined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.html#iam-access-control-use-cases) scoped only to the topic provided. For mTLS authentication, the method applies an ACL for the provided `Common Name` that allow read operations on the topic.

```python
kafka_api.grant_consume("consume", "foo", Authentication.MTLS, "User:Cn=bar")
```
