    The last greenscreen clip used to build a video. This clip will
    have the actual used greenscreen resource duration, so you can
    now how long is the greenscreen actually. You can use this clip
    to obtain the 'duration' when the 'from_image_to_video' or 
    'from_video_to_video' method is used so you can now how much 
    time is actually on greenscreen and how much is left because of
    the resource duration.

    You must remember that if a greenscreen of 3 seconds is applied
    over a video of 5 seconds of duration, only the 3 first secconds
    will be with the greenscreen, and the other 2 seconds will remain
    as in the original video.
