## Documentation
Documentation is on [Read the Docs](https://encommon.readthedocs.io).
Should you venture into the sections below you will be able to use the
`sphinx` recipe to build documention in the `docs/html` directory.

## Projects using library
- [Enasis Network Remote Connect](https://github.com/enasisnetwork/enconnect)
- [Enasis Network Homie Automate](https://github.com/enasisnetwork/enhomie)
- [Enasis Network Chatting Robie](https://github.com/enasisnetwork/enrobie)

## Installing the package
Installing stable from the PyPi repository
```
pip install encommon
```
Installing latest from GitHub repository
```
pip install git+https://github.com/enasisnetwork/encommon
```

## Quick start for local development
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/enasisnetwork/encommon.git
```
Set up the Python virtual environments expected by the Makefile.
```
make -s venv-create
```

### Execute the linters and tests
The comprehensive approach is to use the `check` recipe. This will stop on
any failure that is encountered.
```
make -s check
```
However you can run the linters in a non-blocking mode.
```
make -s linters-pass
```
And finally run the various tests to validate the code and produce coverage
information found in the `htmlcov` folder in the root of the project.
```
make -s pytest
```
