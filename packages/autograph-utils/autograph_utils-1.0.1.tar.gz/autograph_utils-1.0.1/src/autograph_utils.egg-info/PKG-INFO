Features
--------

SignatureVerifier
=================

The canonical implementation of certificate chain validation. Although
some other implementations seem to exist (such as
https://github.com/river2sea/X509Validation,
https://github.com/alex/x509-validator, and
https://github.com/openstack/cursive), all are marked as
pre-production and/or needing work, so just do it ourselves.
