## Introduction

This python package allows you to run a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) offline using a standard csv file as an input. Using this tool, any organisation can harness the power of MCS without relying on SaaS products or third-party tools.

Feel free to check out the code, propose improvements and also make it your own by adjusting it to your context and potentially integrating it into your pipeline. The true power of MCS comes when applied continuously. This tool is provided for free by [LetPeopleWork](https://letpeople.work). If you are curious about Flow Metrics, Kanban, #NoEstimates etc., feel free to reach out to us and book a call! #!LINK NEEDED

## Getting Started
To get started, follow the steps in **Installation** below.

For more information, check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/wiki) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/wiki/FAQ).

If you have any further questions about using this tool, feel free to ask them in the [Discussion](https://github.com/huserben/MonteCarloCSV/discussions) tab.

## Installation
In order to run this tool, you will need python v3.9 at minimum on your machine.

### Installing python
1. To download python, please visit https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install python on your machine.
3. Add python to your `PATH` variable.

Check if you have successfully installed python by entering `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal window. If one of these commands works without error, you are ready to install MCS.

### Installing MCS

If you have installed python, you can download `montecarlocsv` via `pip` using the following terminal command:

`python -m pip install --upgrade montecarlocsv`

## Run montecarlocsv
To test whether your installation is successful, run `montecarlocsv` in a terminal using the command line.

When `montecarlocsv` is run without any parameters, it will use preset values and generate an `ExampleFile.csv` with dummy data to your current directory. The application will use this data as an input and runs a Monte Carlo simulation with an output similar to the one below:

```

If you can see an output like this, you are now ready to configure `montecarlocsv` and use the tool with your own data.

## "How Many" and "When"
To run the MC Simulations with `montecarlocsv`, you need various inputs. First and foremost, you need to provide a csv file that includes the date when an item was closed. The csv can contain other information, but it's not needed nor relevant for the MC Simulation. Then we need a target date to calculate *how many* items we manage till this date based on the past throughput. We can also calculate *when* a specific amount of items will be done. If we have both a target date and the remaining items we want to achieve till this date, we can also calculate the likelihood of managing those items till the target date.
To specify "how much history" should be used: Do you want to use the last 30 days or rather the last 90 days for your calculation?



## Setting up your CSV files

We created tutorials to help you create the input CSV file using [Azure DevOps](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/wiki/Azure-DevOps) and [Jira](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/wiki/Jira). If you are using a different work management system and have a way to export the CSV file as an input for MCS, reach out to us -- we're looking for [Contributors](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV#contributions).

**Note**: It's recommended to name your csv files to something more meaningful (like *TeamName.csv*) and to specify this when running the tool: `montecarlocsv --FileName "TeamName.csv"`.

## Parameters
You can specify several arguments to adjust `montecarlocsv` according to your needs. Below you find a table with the parameters, their description and the default values that are used when nothing else is supplied:

```
parser.add_argument("--FileName", default='ExampleFile.csv')
parser.add_argument("--ClosedDateColumn", default="Closed Date")
parser.add_argument("--DateFormat", default="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
parser.add_argument("--TargetDate", default="08.04.2024")
parser.add_argument("--TargetDateFormat", default="%d.%m.%Y")
parser.add_argument("--RemainingItems", default=78)
parser.add_argument("--History", default="90")
```
Name | Description | Default |
--- | --- | --- |
--FileName | The name of the csv file to be used for the simulation. Can be a relative path (using '.') or an absolute one | Empty. If nothing is provided, an example file is autogenerated with the name "ExampleFile.csv" that is matching all default parameters. You can overwrite other parameters and leave *FileName* empty, then the auto-generated file will take the other parameters into account. |
--Delimiter | The delimiter that is used in the file specified. | Default is ; |
--ClosedDateColumn | The name of the column in the csv file that contains the closed date. | Default is "Closed Date" |
--DateFormat | The format of the date in the csv file. Check [Python Dates](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) for the options you have (or ask ChatGPT) | Default is "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" |
--TargetDate | The target date for the simulation. It might be obvious, but that date should be in the future | If no Target Date is specified, it will take 14 days in the future |
--TargetDateFormat | The format of the target date. Check [Python Dates](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) for the options you have (or ask ChatGPT) | Default is "%d.%m.%Y" |
--RemainingItems | The number of remaining items for the simulation. | Default is 10 |
--History | The number of days of history to be used for the simulation. | Default is 30 |
--SaveCharts | If specified, the charts created during the MC Simulation will be stored in a subfolder called "Charts". | Default is False |

# Usage of montecarlocsv in other python scripts
We want to keep this project about running MCS with a CSV input. That said, it might make a lot of sense to directly integrate with your work tracking systems without the need for a CSV export. If you want to reuse `montecarlocsv` in your own python scripts, you can do so in two ways described below.

## Call with sys args
You can simply invoke the whole program and specify the parameters to use, by using `sys.argv`. You can find an example in the following file in the *Examples* folder: [call_via_sys.py](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/blob/main/Examples/call_via_sys.py)

## Use Individual Services
If you don't want to call the full application, you can also call the different services.
In [use_individual_services.py](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/blob/main/Examples/use_individual_services.py) in the *Examples* folder you can see how this could look like.

Using the [CsvService](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/blob/main/MonteCarloCSV/CsvService.py) we first get a list of all our closed items. Then we generate the throughput history via the [MonteCarloService](https://github.com/LetPeopleWork/MonteCarloCSV/blob/main/MonteCarloCSV/MonteCarloService.py).

With this history, we then can run a  *When* and *How Many* simulation.

# Contributions
We're happy if you want to contribute. The following ways of contribution are possible:
- Do you have an idea for an additional feature? Share it with us in the [Discussions](https://github.com/huserben/MonteCarloCSV/discussions)
- Want to improve the code or extend the functionality? Feel free to create a Pull Request. However, please make sure to check first in the discussion if the feature is needed & wanted. We want to keep this generic and not make it overcomplicated, so we might intentionally leave some things out that you would get in other, full-blown SaaS tools.
- Contribute to our [Wiki](https://github.com/huserben/MonteCarloCSV/wiki) by sharing how-to's for your work tracking system or asking (or answering) frequently asked questions.
- If you have forked this repo and adjusted it to work directly with your work tracking system, why not keep that open-source and share it here, so we can link it.
