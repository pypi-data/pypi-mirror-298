TISTOS method for trigger efficiencies
=======================================================

TISTOS is a data-driven method for determining trigger efficiencies, discussed (including full proof) in full in Ref. [1]_.
This method is briefly outlined below.

Ideally, the efficiency of a trigger selection could be calculated as

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig} = \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig}}{N_\mathrm{Total}},

where :math:`N_\mathrm{Total}` is the total number of events within the acceptance (i.e., which could be triggered) and :math:`N_\mathrm{Trig}` is the number of events which are triggered on.
More frequently :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig}` is defined in terms of the number of events in a sample subject to some form of selection, :math:`N_\mathrm{Sel}`:.
The Trig, TIS, TOS and TISTOS categories discussed here are all assumed to be conditional on this selection, with the :math:`\mathrm{\vert Sel}` generally dropped for convenience.

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.} = \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig\vert Sel}}{N_\mathrm{Sel}}.

However, since triggering is a destructive process, :math:`N_\mathrm{Total}/N_\mathrm{Sel}`  are not known quantities in data (in simulation we can keep this information, which makes our lives much easier).
As such, we will need to get creative.

We start by defining categories in terms of the trigger response on each event and with respect to a given signal (i.e., a particle in the channel of interest):

* **Trig.**: The trigger fires on the event.
* **TOS**: The presence of the signal causes the trigger to fire on the event. Specifically, at least 70% of hits in the reconstructed trigger candidates are hits associated with the signal.
* **TIS**: The trigger fires on the event regardless of the signal. Specifically, if any of the reconstructed trigger candidates share fewer than 1% of hits with the signal.
* **TISTOS**: The event is both TIS and TOS.

Each of the TIS/TOS/TISTOS categories then has a corresponding efficiency:

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS/TOS/TISTOS} = \frac{N_\mathrm{TIS/TOS/TISTOS}}{N_\mathrm{Sel}}.

These are particularly useful because :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.}` can be expanded as

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.} = \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig}}{N_\mathrm{Sel}} =  \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig}}{N_\mathrm{TIS}} \frac{N_\mathrm{TIS}}{N_\mathrm{Sel}} = \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig}}{N_\mathrm{TIS}} \varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS}.

Whilst :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS}` was previously defined in terms of :math:`N_\mathrm{Sel}`, this efficieny can be defined within the TOS subsample as

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS\vert TOS} = \frac{N_\mathrm{TISTOS}}{N_\mathrm{TOS}},

which is equivalent to :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS}` under the assumption that :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS}` of any subsample is identical to that of the full sample.
Plugging this into the expression for \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.} yields the final expression for \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.} (as implemented in the tools),

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.} = \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig}}{N_\mathrm{TIS}} \frac{N_\mathrm{TISTOS}}{N_\mathrm{TOS}}.

A frequently-used proxy for this trigger efficiency, :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TOS}` can be defined in a similar way to :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS}`:

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{TOS\vert TIS} = \frac{N_\mathrm{TISTOS}}{N_\mathrm{TIS}},

equivalent to :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TOS}` under a similar assumption that :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TOS}` is the same in the whole sample as in any subsample.
Both :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TOS}` and :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{TIS}` are also implemented in the tool.

These assumptions of TIS/TOS subsample-independence are not strictly true as, the signal and the rest of the event are frequently correlated, e.g.,, in the case of :math:`B` mesons, where the :math:`b\bar{b}` are produced as a pair and hence both :math:`B` are correlated.
This correlation can be circumvented by calculating the counts detailed above in sufficiently small phase space bins.
Performing such a binning, the expression for :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.}` becomes

.. math:: 

    \varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.} = \frac{N_\mathrm{Trig}}{\sum\limits_i N^i_\mathrm{TIS}} \frac{\sum\limits_i N^i_\mathrm{TISTOS}}{\sum\limits_i N^i_\mathrm{TOS}}.

For more details and a derivation of the error propagation for :math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{Trig.}` (also as implemented in the tools), it is highly recommended that you read Ref. [1]_
