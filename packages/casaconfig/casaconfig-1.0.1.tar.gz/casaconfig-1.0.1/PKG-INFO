## Developers Instructions
1. every push to the casaconfig repository will push a new wheel to [test pypi](https://test.pypi.org/project/casaconfig/#history)
2. the version in setup.py must be updated before each push so that the wheel has a unique name (e.g. "1.2.3dev2", where "dev?" could be incremented during development)
3. When testing with a casatools build, "pip install" the development casaconfig wheel before running any tests - it may be installed before casatools is installed or after since the casatools build does not depend on casasconfig (uninstall any already installed casaconfig if necessary).
4. For release, follow the above instructions.
