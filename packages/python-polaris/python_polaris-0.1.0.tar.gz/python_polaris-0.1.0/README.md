## **Overview**

**POLARIS** is an open-source astrodynamics and satellite control software developed in Python. Designed for satellite engineers, researchers, and hobbyists, **POLARIS** provides a suite of tools to simulate and control satellite missions, perform orbital dynamics analysis, and integrate satellite operations into real-world or simulated environments.

### **Key Features**
- **Orbital Dynamics Simulation:** Accurate simulation of satellite orbits using numerical methods and keplerian mechanics.
- **Satellite Control:** Tools for station-keeping, attitude control, and orbital adjustments.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Visualize satellite positions, orbits, and ground tracks with live updates.
- **Mission Planning:** Optimize satellite missions, including launch trajectory analysis and on-orbit operations.
- **Open-source and Extensible:** Fully open-source under the MIT license, easily customizable for different use cases.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8+
- Required Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `poliastro`
  - `astropy`

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib poliastro astropy
```

### **Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/POLARIS.git
cd POLARIS
```

### **Installation via `pip`**

You can also install POLARIS as a package using pip (once published):

```bash
pip install polaris-satellite
```

## **Quick Start**

### **1. Orbital Dynamics Simulation**

POLARIS allows users to simulate satellite orbits. Here’s an example of how to simulate a satellite’s orbit around Earth:

```python
from polaris import OrbitalSimulation

# Initialize a new orbital simulation with parameters
sim = OrbitalSimulation(semi_major_axis=7000, eccentricity=0.01, inclination=28.5)

# Run the simulation
sim.run()

# Plot the orbital trajectory
sim.plot_orbit()
```

### **2. Satellite Control (Attitude and Station Keeping)**

POLARIS includes a suite of tools to control satellite positioning and execute station-keeping maneuvers:

```python
from polaris import SatelliteControl

# Initialize satellite control for an orbit
control = SatelliteControl(satellite_id='Droid001')

# Perform station-keeping maneuver
control.perform_station_keeping(target_altitude=7000)

# Execute attitude adjustments for imaging
control.adjust_attitude(target_angle=45)
```

### **3. Mission Planning and Optimization**

Plan and optimize satellite missions, including adjusting orbital parameters for maximum efficiency:

```python
from polaris import MissionPlanner

# Set up a mission planner for a satellite
mission = MissionPlanner(satellite_id='Droid001')

# Optimize the satellite’s orbit for energy efficiency
mission.optimize_orbit()

# Get the optimal launch window
launch_window = mission.calculate_launch_window()
print(f"Optimal Launch Window: {launch_window}")
```
