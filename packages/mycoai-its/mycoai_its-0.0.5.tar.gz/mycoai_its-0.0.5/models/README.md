# Models
To keep the Git repository concise, we refer to [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10904344) for the
trained MycoAI model and its the variants as described and compared in the 
paper. We provide all taxonomic labels that are known by MycoAI in [this](MycoAI_known_labels.json) json file.
