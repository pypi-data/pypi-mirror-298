# The purpose of this file is to trigger review requests when PRs touch
# particular files. Those reviews are not mandatory, however it's often useful
# to have an expert pinged who is interested in only one part of codetypo and
# doesn't follow general development.
#
# Note that only GitHub handles (whether individuals or teams) with commit
# rights should be added to this file.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners
# for more details about how CODEOWNERS works.

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
