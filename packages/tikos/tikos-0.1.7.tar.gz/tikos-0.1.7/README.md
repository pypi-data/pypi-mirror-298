1. v 0.0.7, added 

   i. GetGraphStructure: Automatically extract graph Vertices and Edges that can be further refined by the user

   ii. GenerateGraph: Provide Tikos Reasoning Platform the refined graph Vertices and Edges to build the standard knowledge graph

   iii. GetGraph: Get the whole graph for an extraction request

   iv. GetGraphRelationships: Get relationships between two Vertexes

2. v 0.0.8, added

   i. GetGraphRetrieval: Retrieve query response along with the Graph relationships for the requested retrieve query

3. v 0.0.9, added

   i. GetGraphRetrievalWithDS: Retrieve query response along with the Graph relationships for the requested retrieve query with Graph Node data sets as JSON

4. v 0.1.0, added

   i. Licence conditions

5. v 0.1.1

   i. Added, ProcessExtractFile: Be able to extract data from a specific file and support JSON based extraction using jq based schemas
