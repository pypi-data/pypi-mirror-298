# Hygen Add

**Disclaimer** this is a spiritual fork of https://github.com/jondot/hygen-add which currently
seems to not be working. 

Usage example:

`hygen-add https://github.com/italomaia/hygen-axum-podman-template`

Basically this package installs a executable that will download the hygen `_templates` folder 
from a github repository of your choice into the current folder. `npx hygen` should work fine
with this setup and you can keep your templates together.
