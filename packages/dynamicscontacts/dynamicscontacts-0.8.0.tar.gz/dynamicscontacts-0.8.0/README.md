# Dynamics Dataverse API Library - Contact Management
Dynamics Customer Insights - Journeys - Dataverse

This library provides a set of functions to interact with Microsoft Dataverse (formerly known as Common Data Service) using the Dynamics 365 REST API. It includes functionalities for authentication, searching contacts, adding contacts, and updating contacts.

## Installation

To use this library, you need to have `requests` and `json` modules installed. You can install `requests` using pip:
```sh
pip install requests
```
Now you need to install the Dynamics library:
```sh
pip install dynamicscontacts
```
## Usage
Import the library
```python
from dynamics import contacts
```
### Authentication - Return Access Token
This function authenticates and returns an access token required for accessing Dataverse.
```python
    # Replace these variables with your actual values
    tenant_id = 'tenant_id'
    client_id = 'client_id'
    client_secret = 'client_secret'
    tenant_name = 'tenant_name'
    crm_url = f"https://{tenant_name}.crm4.dynamics.com/"
    # Create Access Token
    access_token = contacts.accessToken(tenant_id, client_id, client_secret, crm_url)
```
Now if the access_token is generated successfully you may proceed, otherwise make sure you setup the environment correctly.

## Search Contact in Dynamics
This function searches for a contact in Dataverse based on the provided search criteria.
```python
    # Search for a contact
    search_params = {
        "firstname": "fname",
        "lastname": "lname",
        "emailaddress1": "email"
    }
    # You may customize the returned fields here
    return_fields = "firstname,lastname,emailaddress1,mobilephone"
    crm_contacts = contacts.search_contacts(crm_url, access_token, search_params, return_fields)
    print(contacts)
```
## Add Contact to Dynamics
This function adds a new contact to Dataverse.
```python
   contact_data = {
        "firstname": "fname",
        "lastname": "lname",
        "birthdate": "%Y-%m-%d",
        "emailaddress1": "email",
        "mobilephone": "12345678"
    }
    # Add contact to Dataverse
    add_crm_contact = contacts.add_contact(contact_data, crm_url, access_token)
```

## Update Contacts in Dynamics
This function updates an existing contact in Dataverse based on the provided contact ID and update data.
```python
    # Update contracts
    update_data = {
        "firstname": "fname",
        "lastname": "lname"
    }
    contact_id= "contactid"
    updated_crm_contact = contacts.update_contact(access_token, contact_id, update_data, crm_url)
```
## Delete Contacts in Dynamics
This function Deletes an existing contact in Dataverse based on the provided contact ID. You need to make sure that you have the proper permissions and that there are not dependent records connected to this contact.
```python
    contact_id = ''  # Replace with the actual contact ID

    deleted = contacts.delete_contact(crm_url, access_token, contact_id)
    if deleted:
        print("Contact deleted successfully")
    else:
        print("Error deleting contact")
```
