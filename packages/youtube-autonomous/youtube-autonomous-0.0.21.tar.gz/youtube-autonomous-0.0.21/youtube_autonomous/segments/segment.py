    manually provided to the project. This is a voice narration that will
    should be included as the audio of the segment, transcripted and used
    in the video generation. This parameter can be provided, in which case
    it will be used as the main audio and will be transcripted, or could 
    be not provided. This parameter, if provided, will generate the
    segment 'transcription' parameter.
    """
