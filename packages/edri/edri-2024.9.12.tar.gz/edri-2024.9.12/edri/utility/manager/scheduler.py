        repeat (Union[timedelta, bool]): Indicates how often the job should repeat.

        get_next_job(): Retrieves the next job to be executed, based on its scheduled time.
        run_pending(): Executes pending jobs based on the current time and schedules
        repeat executions if necessary.
