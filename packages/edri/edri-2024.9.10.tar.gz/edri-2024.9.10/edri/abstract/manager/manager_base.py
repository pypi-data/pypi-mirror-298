        a request or response handler in the `_requests` or `_responses` dictionaries

            a warning message and continues to the next method.
         3. For valid methods, it retrieves the `event` type by calling `get_event()`
            with the method's signature.
         4. If the method name starts with 'solve_req_', it associates the method with
            the event type in the `_requests` dictionary.

        Handles the store get response for retrieving data from the Store. This method determines whether

        The method first checks if the event is associated with a worker. If the event's `_worker` attribute
        is set and matches a worker managed by this instance, the event is sent to that worker via its communication
        pipe. If no matching worker is found, or if the `_worker` attribute is not set, the method attempts to handle

        Behavior:
            - If the event specifies a worker (via the `_worker` attribute), the method directs the response to that worker.
            - If no worker is specified or found, the event is passed to the manager's own `_store_get` method for standard handling,
              provided that `_store_get` has been defined. If `_store_get` is not defined, the event is effectively ignored.

        Note:
            - The `_store_get` method is an optional user-defined method. If it is not defined, this method will not attempt to
              handle the event beyond checking for a worker.

        between the manager and the router, facilitating the dispatch and handling of events.

        Parameters:
            router_queue (Optional[Queue[Event]]): The event queue used for communication with the router. If provided,
                                                   this queue will be set as the current router queue for the manager.
                                                   This queue is essential for the manager to receive and process events.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: Raised if no router queue is provided and no router queue has been set previously. This
                          exception ensures that the manager cannot start without a means to communicate with the
                          router, as the lack of a router queue would prevent the manager from functioning correctly.

        Note:
            If a router queue is not provided as an argument to this method, the manager will attempt to use a
            previously set router queue. It's essential to either provide a router queue when calling this method
            or set one before its execution. Failure to do so will result in a RuntimeError, indicating the
            manager's inability to start due to the absence of a communication channel with the router.

        Example:
            To start the manager, you may either provide a router queue directly when calling the start method
            or ensure that the manager has a router queue set beforehand. This flexibility allows for different
            use cases, such as reusing an existing queue or setting a new one as needed.
