# HistoryArgumentParser

## Why Track Command History?

Have you ever found yourself wondering:
- "What parameters did I use for that successful run last week?"
- "How can I replicate the exact configuration from my previous experiments?"
- "Is there an easy way to audit how my script has been used over time?"

HistoryArgumentParser is here to solve these problems and more!

## What is HistoryArgumentParser?

HistoryArgumentParser is an extension of Python's built-in `argparse.ArgumentParser` that automatically tracks and stores the command-line arguments used in your scripts. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for ArgumentParser, adding powerful history tracking capabilities with minimal changes to your existing code.

## Key Features

- 📜 Automatic command history tracking
- 🕰️ Timestamped entries for easy reference
- 🔍 Built-in history viewing functionality
- 📁 Customizable history file location
- 🔌 Seamless integration with existing argparse code

## Installation

Install HistoryArgumentParser with pip:

```bash
pip install argparse_history
```

## Quick Start
Replace your existing ArgumentParser with HistoryArgumentParser:

```python
from history_argparse import HistoryArgumentParser

parser = HistoryArgumentParser(description="Your script description")
parser.add_argument('--input', help='Input file', required=True)
parser.add_argument('--output', help='Output file', required=True)

args = parser.parse_args()

# Your script logic here

```

That's it! Your script now tracks command history automatically.

### Viewing Command History
To view the command history, simply run your script with the --show-history flag:

```bash
python your_script.py --show-history
```

This will display a list of previous runs with their timestamps and arguments.

#### Customizing History File Location

By default, the history is stored in the current directory. You can specify a custom directory:

```bash
python your_script.py --input in.txt --output out.txt --history-dir /path/to/history
```

## Why Choose HistoryArgumentParser?

1. Effortless Integration: Minimal changes to your existing code.
2. Improved Reproducibility: Easily recreate previous runs.
3. Better Debugging: Quickly identify what parameters were used in past executions.
4. Audit Trail: Keep track of how and when your script is being used.
5. Time-Saving: No more manual logging of script parameters.
