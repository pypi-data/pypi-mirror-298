    A backend defines where and how all Savable objects (inheriting from the Savable
    class) save their data. This is a key part of the seamless interoperability of
    ixdat classes and experimental databases. Each Savable class roughly corresponds
    to a table, and the save() and get() functions correspond to inserting and
    selecting from a database table.

    Backends inheriting from this base class are in modules of the ixdat.backends folder

    Savable objects will by default be initiated with this base (backend="none")
    backend. Objects which ixdat should keep track of for use in multiple places in
    a workflow should instead be initiated with MemoryBackend (backend="memory").
    Other backends imply an object is saved to or loaded form a database including
    ixdat's directory backend (backend="directory")
