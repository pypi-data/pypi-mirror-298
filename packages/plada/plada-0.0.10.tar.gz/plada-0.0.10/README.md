**PlaDa** (**Pla**tform for **Da**ta market)

PlaDa is a simulation platform designed to model and analyze data-driven marketplaces. It provides tools for setting up market models, configuring simulation parameters, running simulations, and analyzing results.

## Install
PlaDa is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip.
#### Using pip
```
$ pip install plada
$ python
>> import plada
```
#### Using pip in a Jupyter Notebook
When installing within a Jupyter Notebook, use the !pip command:
```
!pip install plada
import plada
```
For more detailed examples, refer to the [test.ipynb](https://github.com/junsashihara/plada/blob/master/examples/test.ipynb) notebook.

## Usage
#### Step1：Set up the Market Model.
Note: The model must be a Graph object and must contain "variables".
```
model = nx.read_graphml("test.graphml")
```
#### Step2：Configure Settings
Define the configuration for the simulation, market, and agents.
```
config = {
    "Simulation":{
        "num_iterations": 10,
        "num_steps": 10,
        "isPrice": True,
    },
    "Market":{
        "model": model,
    },
    "Agent": {
        "num_buyers": 10,
        "strategy_weights": {
            "random": 0.0,
            "related": 0.0,
            "ranking": 1.0,
        },
        "new_buyer_probability": 0.8,
    }
}
```
#### Step3：Run the Simulation
Initialize the `Saver` and `Runner` classes with the configuration settings and logger. Then, execute the main simulation process.
```
saver = Saver()
runner = Runner(settings=config, logger=saver)

runner.main()
```

## Explanation
buyer.py
- **Configuration of Buyer Agent**
- Manages the state and strategies of buyers, updates budget, and saves purchased data.

market.py
- **Market Class**: Manages the overall market.
- **Data Class**: Manages the data.
- **Variable Class**: Manages the variables.
- Primarily responsible for updating prices and related market dynamics.

simulator.py
- **Setup of the Purchase Simulation Workflow**
- Organizes the information to be logged (requires improvement)

runner.py
- **Execution of the Simulation**

logger.py
- **Saving the Results of the Simulation**

analyzer.py
- **Basic Analysis of the Results**
- Visualizes the distribution of purchase counts.
