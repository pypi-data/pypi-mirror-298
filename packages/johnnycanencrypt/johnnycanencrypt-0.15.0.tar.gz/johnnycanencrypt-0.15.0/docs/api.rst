API Documentation
==================

For the rest of the documentation we assume that you imported the module as following.

::


        >>> import johnnycanencrypt as jce




.. class:: KeyStore(path: StrOrBytesPath) -> None:

        Returns a KeyStore object. This is the primary class of the module, and
        all high level usage is available via methods of this class. It takes a
        path to the directory where it stores/reads the keys. Please make sure
        that only the **user** has read/write capability to this path.

        The keys are represented inside the directory in the **jce.db** sqlite3
        database. Every time there is any change in the DB schema, we
        automatically create a temporary database called **jce_upgrade.db** in
        the same path, and then reimport all the keys, and rename the file and
        continue with the steps. This is one time operation when we do a new
        release.

        You can check for existence of any fingerprint (str) or `Key` object in the via `in` operator.

        .. method:: add_userid(key: Key, userid: str, password: str) -> Key:

                Returns the updated key with a new userid. If you need to upload the key to the https://keys.openpgp.org, then remember to
                have to an email address in the user id.

        .. method:: certify_key(key: Union[Key, str], otherkey: Union[Key, str], uids: List[str], sig_type: SignatureType = SignatureType.GenericCertification, password: str = "", oncard=False) -> Key:

                This method signs the given list of userid(s) in `otherkey` using the primary key of the `key`, by default it signs as *SignatureType.GenericCertification*, but you can do other types too. If the primary key is on a smartcard, then pass `oncard=True`, default value is `False`.

        .. method:: create_key(password: str, uids: Optional[Union[List[str], str]] = [], ciphersuite: Cipher = Cipher.RSA4k, creation: Optional[datetime.datetime] = None, expiration: Optional[datetime.datetime] = None, subkeys_expiration= False, whichkeys = 7, can_primary_sign: bool = False, can_primary_expire=False) -> Key:

                Returns the public part of the newly created `Key` in the store
                directory. You can mention ciphersuite :class:`Cipher`  as
                *Cipher.RSA2k* or *Cipher.RSA4k*, or *Cipher.Cv25519*, while
                *Cipher.RSA4k* is the default. You can also provide
                `datetime.datetime` objects for creation time and expiration
                time. By default it will use the current time as creation time,
                and keys don't expire. You can provide a string for uid, or multiple
                strings using a List for multiple uids. It can also create a key without
                any uids.

                If you want the primary key to have signing capability, then pass `can_primary_sign=True`.

                You can pass `whichkeys = 1` to generate only the encryption subkey, 2 for signing, 4 for authentication.
                By default it will create all three subkeys (7).

                ::

                        >>> ks = jce.KeyStore("/var/lib/myamazingapp")

        .. method:: encrypt(keys, data, outputfile="", armor=True) -> bytes:

                Encrypts the given data (either as str or bytes) via the list of keys or fingerprints. You can also just pass one single key or
                fingerprint. If you provide *outputfile* argument with a path, the encrypted output will be written to that path. By default the
                encrypted output is armored, but by passing *armor=False* you can get raw bytes returned.

        .. method:: encrypt_file(keys, inputfilepath: Union[str,bytes,BinaryIO], outputfilepath: Union[str, bytes], armor=True) -> bool:

                Returns `True` after encrypting the given *inputfilepath* to the *outputfilepath*. The *inputfilepath* could be `str`, or `bytes`, or a opened file handler for bytes.

                Decryptes the given *encrypted_path* and wrties the output to the *outputfile* path (both given as str or bytes). In the *encrypted_path* can be an opened file handler to read
                binary data.
