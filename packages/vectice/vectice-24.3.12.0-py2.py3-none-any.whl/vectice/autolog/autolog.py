"""Auto-Logging assets with Vectice.

NOTE: **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
    Autolog is continuously evolving to enhance supported libraries, environments, and functionalities to provide an improved user experience.

    Your feedback is highly valued. Please send any feedback to support@vectice.com.

------------
The autolog feature in Vectice allows for seamless documentation and management of your data science projects. Please note the following details about this feature.

NOTE: **This feature is designed to work specifically with notebooks.**

1.** Installation:**
    Make sure you install Vectice package using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install vectice
    ```

2.** Supported libraries and environment:**
    Vectice automatically identifies and log assets encapsulated within a specified list of supported libraries and environement mentioned below

NOTE: **Supported libraries and environment**
    - Dataframe: Pandas, Spark.
    - Model: Scikit, Xgboost, Lightgbm, Catboost, Keras, Pytorch, Statsmodels.
    - Graphs: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
    - Environments: Colab, Jupyter, Vertex, SageMaker, Databricks, Pycharm and VScode notebook.

3.** General behavior:**
    Vectice autolog provides three methods: autolog.config, autolog.notebook, and autolog.cell. These methods are designed to log every asset to Vectice existing as a variable in the notebook's memory. It is important to review the specific behaviors outlined in the documentation for each of these three methods.

NOTE: **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
    - For GRAPHS, ensure they are saved as files or the plot is displayed to be automatically logged in the iteration i.e
        - In inline environments like Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Hub (not IDEs), using `plt.show()` can flush the canvas, potentially preventing displayed or saved graphs from being captured.
          To avoid this, use only `plt.savefig()` to save your figures instead of or before calling `plt.show()`.
          See here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/interactive.html
        - fig.write_image("my figure.png") (for plotly)
    - For METRICS, Vectice currently recognizes sklearn metrics for automatic association with models.
        - In cases there's ambiguity due to multiple models with different metrics, Vectice won't automatically link them. To establish the link, make sure each model and its respective metrics are placed within the same notebook cell.
