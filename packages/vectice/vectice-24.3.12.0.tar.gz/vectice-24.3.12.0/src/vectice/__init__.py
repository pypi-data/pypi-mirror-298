"""Vectice package.

The Vectice package is a library allowing data-scientists
to record their progress in the [Vectice app](https://docs.vectice.com/).

This package exposes essential Vectice classes and methods:

- the [autolog][vectice.autolog.autolog] method
- the [connect][vectice.Connection.connect] method
- the [Workspace][vectice.models.Workspace] class
- the [Project][vectice.models.Project] class
- the [Phase][vectice.models.Phase] class
- the [Iteration][vectice.models.Iteration] class
- the [Dataset][vectice.Dataset] class
- the [Model][vectice.Model] class
- the [Table][vectice.Table] class

    NOTE: **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
        Vectice calculates dataframe statistics only if the dataframe contains more than a hundred rows for privacy reasons. Those statistics are calculate on a sample of a million rows and on the first 400 columns by default. All of these values can be changed on the Organization Settings page by the organization admin.

"""Global code capture flag, enabled by default.

Code capture is triggered when registering a dataset or a model,
and only works when a valid Git repository is found.
Otherwise a warning is logged, telling what might be misconfigured in the repository.

Captured information include the repository name, URL, branch name, commit hash,
and whether the repository is dirty (has uncommitted changes).

Examples:
    To disable code capture globally:

    >>> import vectice
    >>> vectice.code_capture = False

    To re-enable code capture globally:

    >>> import vectice
    >>> vectice.code_capture = True

"""Global code file capture flag, disabled by default.

Controls whether code file is captured when logging asset into Vectice as part of the lineage.
When enabled (set to True), logging an asset will also add the executed file to its lineage.
Enabling this feature may increase API runtime due to file transfer. Databricks is currently not supported.


Examples:
    To enable code_file_capture globally:

    >>> import vectice
    >>> vectice.code_file_capture = True

    To re-enable code file capture globally:

    >>> import vectice
    >>> vectice.code_file_capture = False

Extraction is automatically performed when registering a dataset or a model with an attachment. Currently, it exclusively operates on Excel files and extracts sheets (as CSV files) and images to be referenced inside Vectice.

Examples:
    To disable auto extraction of files globally globally:

    >>> import vectice

    To re-enable auto extraction globally:
