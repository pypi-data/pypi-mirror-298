V8.0.0: MC, Oxford, 26 September 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Breaking changes to the overall package interface. However, the necessary
  modifications can be easily made using search and replace. There are no
  changes to the internal code. The new interface enhances discoverability and
  autocompletion of functions in current Python editors, and it simplifies
  imports. Previous calls like:

  .. code-block:: python
  
    from jampy.jam_axi_intr import jam_axi_intr
    from jampy.jam_axi_proj import jam_axi_proj
    from jampy.jam_axi_sersic import jam_axi_sersic_mass

    from jampy.jam_sph_intr import jam_sph_intr    
    from jampy.jam_sph_proj import jam_sph_proj    

    from jampy.mge_cylindrical_mass import mge_cylindrical_mass
    from jampy.mge_radial_density import mge_radial_density
    from jampy.mge_radial_mass import mge_radial_mass
    from jampy.mge_half_light_isophote import mge_half_light_isophote
    from jampy.mge_vcirc import mge_vcirc

    out = jam_axi_intr(...)
    out = jam_axi_proj(...)
    out = jam_axi_sersic_mass(...)

    out = jam_sph_proj(...)
    out = jam_sph_intr(...)

    out = mge_cylindrical_mass(...)
    out = mge_radial_density(...)
    out = mge_radial_mass(...)
    out = mge_half_light_isophote(...)
    out = mge_vcirc(...)
  
  must be converted into:

  .. code-block:: python
  
    import jampy as jam

    out = jam.axi.proj(...)
    out = jam.axi.intr(...)
    out = jam.axi.sersic_mass(...)

    out = jam.sph.proj(...)
    out = jam.sph.intr(...)

    out = jam.mge.cylindrical_mass(...)
    out = jam.mge.half_light_isophote(...)
    out = jam.mge.radial_density(...)
    out = jam.mge.radial_mass(...)
    out = jam.mge.vcirc(...)


V7.2.6: MC, Oxford, 04 August 2024
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``quad1d``: Replaced ``np.Inf`` with ``np.inf`` for compatibility with the
  latest NumPy 2.0.

V7.2.5: MC, Oxford, 20 May 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``quad1d`` and ``quad2d``: Require positive values for either ``epsrel`` or
  ``epsabs`` keywords. Thanks to Carlos Melo (cufrgs.br) for the feedback.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Dropped support for Python 3.9.

V7.2.4: MC, Oxford, 10 January 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Support prolate models with ``qobs_lum > 1`` or 
  ``qobs_pot > 1``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Output unconvolved surface brightness ``jam.flux`` when no
  PSF/aperture convolution is applied to the kinematics, due to zero
  ``sigmapsf`` or ``pixsize``.
- ``mge_vcirc``: Use scale-independent integration ranges like other JamPy
  functions.
- ``jam_axi_sersic``: Include ``sigma_e`` in the output and enable rotated
  aperture option. Updated docstring.

V7.2.1: MC, Oxford, 21 July 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_intr``: Integrate all velocity components at the same time with a
  single call to the updated ``quad1d`` and ``quad2d``. Significant speedup.
- ``quad1d``, ``quad2d``: Allow for integration of vector functions. All
  components are integrated over the same set of evaluation points.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Updated verbose output with more information.
- New procedure ``jam_axi_sersic`` to efficiently compute dynamical masses of
  axisymmetric galaxies described by Sersic profiles while allowing for seeing
  and aperture effects and assuming a given intrinsic axial ratio. This is
  meant to be a simple and quick replacement for the similar but less accurate
  virial estimators.
- New utility function ``cosmology_distance`` used in examples.

V7.1.0: MC, Oxford, 5 June 2023
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Separated computation for the black hole kinematics for both the
  cylindrically and spherically-aligned solutions. In both cases, this removed
  one numerical quadrature. This is useful in extreme situations when the
  minimum radius one wants to model around the black hole is orders of
  magnitude smaller than the smallest MGE Gaussian. This change eliminated the
  need for the ``rbh`` keyword in ``jam_axi_intr``, which I removed. The only
  case where the black hole is still approximated with a small Gaussian is in
  ``jam_axi_proj`` when both ``align='cyl'`` and ``analytic_los=True``.
- Adopted minimum radius based on ``step`` for the intrinsic interpolation grid
  as already done for the projected one.
- Simplified minimum-inclination test.
- Removed ``legacy`` folder with old redundant procedures.
- Moved the formalism for the LOS analytic integrand with ``align='cyl'`` into
  ``jam_axi_proj``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``, ``jam_axi_intr``, ``jam_sph_proj``, ``jam_sph_intr``: New
  keyword ``logistic`` to specify when JAM should interpret the input
  anisotropy parameters ``beta`` and ``gamma`` as defining a logistic function
  anisotropy profile.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: Use DE quadrature from ``[z, inf]`` instead of ``[0, 1]``
  with ``align='cyl'`` as already done with ``align='sph'``.
- ``jam_hernquist_model_example``: New test against Osipkov-Merritt radial
  variation of the anisotropy using ``logistic=True``. Revised plot.

V7.0.10: MC, Oxford, 17 January 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Introduced an analytic radial variation of the anisotropy ``beta``
  and ``gamma`` using a flexible logistic function of logarithmic radius
  ``beta(r) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]``.
  This function specifies the inner/outer anisotropy ``beta_0`` and
  ``beta_inf``, the anisotropy radius ``r_a`` and the sharpness ``alpha``
  of the transition. This new function is an alternative to assigning
  different anisotropies to different Gaussians. All procedures
  ``jam_axi_proj``, ``jam_axi_intr``, ``jam_sph_proj`` and ``jam_sph_intr``,
  with both ``align='sph'`` and ``align='cyl'``, were modified, documented
  and extensively tested to support the variable-anisotropy function.
- ``jam_sph_proj_example``: adapted to show the usage of the new analytic
  radial anisotropy variation.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: Fixed program stop in the plotting function.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error when ``rbh`` is too small.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error if the user includes the singularity
  ``(x,y) = (0,0)`` in the input coordinates without PSF convolution.
- ``quad1d``: new defaults ``singular=0`` and ``epsabs=0`` like ``quad2d``.

V6.4.0: MC, Oxford, 3 October 2022
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_sph_proj``: Created this new function by renaming the procedure
  ``legacy.jam_sph_rms`` and changing its interface to be consistent with
  the axisymmetric version.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Included special isotropic formula for testing.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Included Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy for testing.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Made quadrature limits insensitive to scaling.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: Simplified integrand with formulas of Cappellari (2020)
  and using recurrence relations to reduce calls to special functions.
- ``jam_sph_proj``: More efficient TANH transformation of the integration
  variable following Cappellari (2020).
- ``jam_sph_intr``: New function to compute the intrinsic moments in
  spherical symmetry.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Removed fixed minimum radius limit in pc for the
  interpolation without PSF convolution. This avoids the risk of artificial 
  truncation when using small arbitrary spatial coordinates for testing.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Tenfold increase of LOS evaluations to ``nlos=1500``.
- New procedure ``examples.jam_dark_halo_bayes_example.py``.
- Renamed ``quadva`` as ``quad1d`` with modified interface and new
  ``singular`` keyword to skip transforming the integration variable.

V6.3.3: MC, Oxford, 7 July 2021

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Clarified meaning of ``interp`` keyword in docstring.     
  Thanks to Kai Zhu (nao.cas.cn) for the feedback.

V6.3.1: MC, Oxford, 11 November 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: New keyword ``analytic_los`` to chose between numeric
  or analytic line-of-sight integral for the second velocity moment,
  when ``align='cyl'``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Increased default value of ``nlos`` keyword.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error if ``rbh`` is too small.
- ``jam_axi_proj`` and ``jam_axi_intr``: Removed ``**kwargs`` argument and
  included new ``nodots`` keyword passed to ``plot_velfield``.

V6.2.1: MC, Oxford, 15 September 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed program stop when ``data == ml == None``.
  Thank to Bitao Wang (pku.edu.cn) for reporting.

V6.2.0: MC, Oxford, 17 August 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Avoid possible division by zero after convolution,
  when the tracer MGE is much smaller than the field of view.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Fully broadcasted ``vmom_proj``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: Removed minimum-radius clipping in ``vmom_proj``.
- ``jam_axi_proj``: New ``interp`` keyword to force no-interpolation
  when using the full first and second velocity moments simultaneously.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed program stop in ``legacy.jam_axi_vel`` due to a variable name typo 
  introduced in V6.1.2.

V6.1.2: MC, Oxford, 20 June 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed input ``ml`` being ignored. Thanks to Sabine
  Thater (univie.ac.at) and Takafumi Tsukui (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting.
- ``jam_axi_rms``: I reduced the interpolation error before the PSF
  convolution for all the routines in the ``legacy`` sub-folder, as already
  implemented in the new ``jam_axi_proj``. Thanks to Takafumi Tsukui
  (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting differences.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: Request input ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vrms_phi]``
  instead of ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vphi]``.
- ``jam_axi_intr``: exclude ``sigphi`` from ``ml`` fitting. These two
  changes make the fitted ``ml`` strictly independent of the adopted
  tangential anisotropy ``gamma``.

  now provide either the intrinsic or the projected moments,
  respectively, for both the spherically-aligned and 
  cylindrically-aligned JAM solutions.
