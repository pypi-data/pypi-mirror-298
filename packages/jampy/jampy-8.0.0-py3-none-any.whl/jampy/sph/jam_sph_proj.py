    Purpose
    -------
    This procedure calculates a prediction for any of the three components of
    the the projected second velocity moments V_RMS = sqrt(V^2 + sigma^2), or
    for a non-rotating galaxy V_RMS = sigma, for an anisotropic spherical
    galaxy model.
    
    It implements the solution of the anisotropic Jeans equations
    presented in equation (50) of `Cappellari (2008, MNRAS, 390, 71).
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C>`_
    PSF convolution is done as described in the Appendix of Cappellari (2008).
    This procedure includes the proper motions calculation given in
    Appendix B3 of `Cappellari (2020, MNRAS, 494, 4819)
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.4819C>`_

    Calling Sequence
    ----------------
    .. code-block:: python

        import jampy as jam

        out = jam.sph.proj(surf_lum, sigma_lum, surf_pot, sigma_pot, mbh,
            distance, rad, beta=None, data=None, epsrel=1e-2, errors=None,
            ml=None, normpsf=1, nrad=50, pixsize=0, plot=True, quiet=False,
            rani=None, sigmapsf=0, step=0, tensor='los')
        sigma_los_model = out.model

    Parameters
    ----------
    surf_lum:
        vector of length N containing the peak surface brightness of the
        MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy surface brightness in units of
        Lsun/pc^2 (solar luminosities per parsec^2).
    sigma_lum:
        vector of length N containing the dispersion in arcseconds of
        the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy surface brightness.
    surf_pot:
        vector of length M containing the peak value of the MGE Gaussians
        describing the galaxy surface density in units of Msun/pc^2 (solar
        masses per parsec^2). This is the MGE model from which the model
        potential is computed.

        In a common usage scenario, with a self-consistent model, one has
        the same Gaussians for both the surface brightness and the potential.
        This implies SURF_POT = SURF_LUM, SIGMA_POT = SIGMA_LUM.
        The M/L, by which SURF_POT has to be multiplied to best match the
        data, is fitted by the routine when passing the RMS and ERMS
        keywords with the observed kinematics.
    sigma_pot:
        vector of length M containing the dispersion in arcseconds of
        the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy surface density.
    mbh:
        Mass of a nuclear supermassive black hole in solar masses.

        VERY IMPORTANT: The model predictions are computed assuming SURF_POT
        gives the total mass. In the common self-consistent case one has
        SURF_POT = SURF_LUM and if requested (keyword ML) the program can scale
        the output RMSMODEL to best fit the data. The scaling is equivalent to
        multiplying *both* SURF_POT and MBH by a factor M/L. To avoid mistakes,
        the actual MBH used by the output model is printed on the screen.
    distance:
        distance of the galaxy in Mpc.
    rad:
        Vector of length P with the (positive) radius from the galaxy center
        in arcseconds of the bins (or pixels) at which one wants to compute
        the model predictions.

        When no PSF/pixel convolution is performed (SIGMAPSF=0 or PIXSIZE=0)
        there is a singularity at RAD=0 which must be avoided.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    beta: array_like with shape (n,) or (4,), optional
        Radial anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer MGE Gaussians
        (Default: ``beta=np.zeros(n)``)::

            beta = 1 - (sigma_th/sigma_r)^2  # with align=`sph`

        When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

            beta = [r_a, beta_0, beta_inf, alpha]

        and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
        function of the logarithmic spherical radius::

            beta(r) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]

        Here ``beta_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``beta_inf``
        is the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy
        transition radius, with ``alpha`` controlling the sharpness of the
        transition. In the special case ``beta_0 = 0, beta_inf = 1, alpha = 2``
        the anisotropy variation reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but
        the extra parameters allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles.
    data:
        Vector of length P with the input observed stellar
        V_RMS=sqrt(velBin^2 + sigBin^2) at the coordinates positions
        given by the vector RAD.

        If RMS is set and ML is negative or not set, then the model is fitted to
        the data, otherwise the adopted ML is used and just the chi^2 is
        returned.
    epsrel: float, optional
        Relative error requested for the numerical quadrature
        (Default: ``epsrel=1e-2``)
    errors:
        Vector of length P with the 1sigma errors associated to the RMS
        measurements. From the error propagation
        ERMS = sqrt((dVel*velBin)^2 + (dSig*sigBin)^2)/RMS,
        where velBin and sigBin are the velocity and dispersion in each bin
        and dVel and dSig are the corresponding errors
        (Default: constant errors=0.05*MEDIAN(data)).
    logistic: bool, optional
        When ``logistic=True``, JAM interprets the anisotropy parameter
        ``beta`` as defining a 4-parameters logistic function.
        See the documentation of the anisotropy keyword for details.
        (Default ``logistic=False``)
    ml:
        Mass-to-light ratio to multiply the values given by SURF_POT.
        Setting this keyword is completely equivalent to multiplying the
        output RMSMODEL by SQRT(M/L) after the fit. This implies that the
        BH mass becomes MBH*(M/L).

        If this keyword is set to a negative number in input, the M/L is
        fitted from the data and the keyword returns the best-fitting M/L
        in output. The BH mass of the best-fitting model is MBH*(M/L).
    normpsf:
        Vector of length Q with the fraction of the total PSF flux
        contained in the various circular Gaussians describing the PSF of the
        observations. It has to be total(NORMPSF) = 1. The PSF will be used for
        seeing convolution of the model kinematics.
    nrad:
        Number of logarithmically spaced radial positions for which the
        models is evaluated before interpolation and PSF convolution. One may
        want to increase this value if the model has to be evaluated over many
        orders of magnitutes in radius (default: NRAD=50).
    pixsize:
        Size in arcseconds of the (square) spatial elements at which the
        kinematics is obtained. This may correspond to the size of the spaxel
        or lenslets of an integral-field spectrograph. This size is used to
        compute the kernel for the seeing and aperture convolution.

        If this is not set, or PIXSIZE = 0, then convolution is not performed.
    plot:
        Set this keyword to produce a plot at the end of the calculation.
    quiet:
        Set this keyword not to print values on the screen.
    rani: float, optional
        If this keyword is set to a numeric value, the program assumes the
        Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy with anisotropy radius ``rani``.
        Setting this keyword is equivalent to setting ``beta = [rani, 0, 1, 2]``
        but for this special anisotropy profile one of the two numerical
        quadratures is analytic and this was useful for testing.
    sigmapsf:
        Vector of length Q with the dispersion in arcseconds of the
        circular Gaussians describing the PSF of the observations.

        If this is not set, or SIGMAPSF = 0, then convolution is not performed.

        IMPORTANT: PSF convolution is done by creating a 2D image, with pixels
        size given by STEP=MAX(SIGMAPSF,PIXSIZE/2)/4, and convolving it with
        the PSF + aperture. If the input radii RAD are very large with respect
        to STEP, the 2D image may require a too large amount of memory. If this
        is the case one may compute the model predictions at small radii
        separately from those at large radii, where PSF convolution is not
        needed.
    step:
        Spatial step for the model calculation and PSF convolution in arcsec.
        This value is automatically computed by default as
        STEP=MAX(SIGMAPSF,PIXSIZE/2)/4. It is assumed that when PIXSIZE or
        SIGMAPSF are big, high resolution calculations are not needed. In some
        cases however, e.g. to accurately estimate the central Vrms in a very
        cuspy galaxy inside a large aperture, one may want to override the
        default value to force smaller spatial pixels using this keyword.

        Use this keyword to set the desired scale of the model when no PSF or
        pixel convolution is performed (SIGMAPSF=0 or PIXSIZE=0).
    tensor:
        Specifies any of the three component of the projected velocity
        dispersion tensor one wants to calculate. Possible options are (i)
        "los" ( default) for the line-of-sight component; (ii) "pmr" for tha
        radial component of the proper motion second moment and (iii) "pmt" for
        the tangential component of the proper motion second moment. All three
        components are computed in km/s at the adopted distance.

    Returns

    .model: array_like with shape (p,)
        Model predictions for the velocity second moments (sigma in the
        spherical non-rotating case) of each bin. The line-of-sigh component
        or either of the proper motion components can be obtained in output
        using the ``tensor`` keyword.
    .ml:
        best fitting M/L.
    .chi2:
        Reduced chi^2 describing the quality of the fit::

            chi^2 = total( ((rms-rmsModel)/erms)^2 ) / n_elements(rms)

    .flux: array_like with shape (p,)
        PSF-convolved MGE surface brightness of each bin in ``Lsun/pc^2``,
        useful to plot the isophotes of the kinematic-tracer on the model
        results.
