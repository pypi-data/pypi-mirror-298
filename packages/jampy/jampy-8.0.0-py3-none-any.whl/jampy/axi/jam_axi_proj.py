    ============

    Purpose
    -------
    This procedure calculates a prediction for all the projected first or second
    velocity moments for an anisotropic (three-integral) axisymmetric galaxy model.

    Any of the three components of the first velocity moment or any of the six
    components of the symmetric velocity dispersion tensor are supported.
    These include the line-of-sight velocities and the components of the proper motion.

    Two assumptions for the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid are supported:

    - The cylindrically-aligned ``(R, z, phi)`` solution was presented in
      `Cappellari (2008) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C>`_

    - The spherically-aligned ``(r, th, phi)`` solution was presented in
      `Cappellari (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.4819C>`_

    Parameters
    ----------
    surf_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
        peak surface values of the `Multi-Gaussian Expansion
        <https://pypi.org/project/mgefit/>`_ (MGE) Gaussians describing the
        surface brightness of the tracer population for which the kinematics
        is derived.

        The units are arbitrary as they cancel out in the final results.

        EXAMPLE: when one obtains the kinematics from optical spectroscopy,
        surf_lum contains the galaxy optical surface brightness, which has
        typical units of ``Lsun/pc^2`` (solar luminosities per ``parsec^2``).
    sigma_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
        dispersion (sigma) in arcseconds of the MGE Gaussians describing the
        distribution of the kinematic-tracer population.
    qobs_lum: array_like with shape (n,)
        observed axial ratio (q') of the MGE Gaussians describing the
        distribution of the kinematic-tracer population.
    surf_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
        peak value of the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy total-mass
        surface density in units of ``Msun/pc^2`` (solar masses per ``parsec^2``).
        This is the MGE model from which the model gravitational potential is
        computed.

        EXAMPLE: with a self-consistent model, one has the same Gaussians
        for both the kinematic-tracer and the gravitational potential.
        This implies ``surf_pot = surf_lum``, ``sigma_pot = sigma_lum`` and
        ``qobs_pot = qobs_lum``. The global M/L of the model is fitted by the
        routine when passing the ``data`` and ``errors`` keywords with the
        observed kinematics.
    sigma_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
        dispersion in arcseconds of the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy
        total-mass surface density.
    qobs_pot: array_like with shape (m,)
        observed axial ratio of the MGE Gaussians describing the galaxy
        total-mass surface density.
    inc: float
        inclination in degrees between the line-of-sight and the galaxy symmetry
        axis (0 being face-on and 90 edge-on).
    mbh: float
        Mass of a nuclear supermassive black hole in solar masses.

        IMPORTANT: The model predictions are computed assuming ``surf_pot``
        gives the total mass. In the self-consistent case, one has
        ``surf_pot = surf_lum`` and if requested (keyword ``ml``) the program
        can scale the output ``model`` to best fit the data. The scaling is
        equivalent to multiplying *both* ``surf_pot`` and ``mbh`` by a factor M/L.
        To avoid mistakes, the actual ``mbh`` used by the output model is
        printed on the screen.
    distance: float
        the distance of the galaxy in ``Mpc``. When the distance is derived 
        from redshift one should use the angular diameter distance ``D_A`` here.
    xbin: array_like with shape (p,)
        X coordinates in arcseconds of the bins (or pixels) at which one wants
        to compute the model predictions. The X-axis is assumed to coincide with
        the galaxy projected major axis. The galaxy center is at ``(0,0)``.
        
        In general the coordinates ``(xbin, ybin)`` have to be rotated to bring 
        the galaxy major axis on the X-axis, before calling ``jam.axi.proj``.

        When no PSF/pixel convolution is performed (``sigmapsf=0`` or
        ``pixsize=0``) there is a singularity at ``(0,0)`` which must be
        avoided by the user in the input coordinates.
    ybin: array_like with shape (p,)
        Y coordinates in arcseconds of the bins (or pixels) at which one wants
        to compute the model predictions. The Y-axis is assumed to coincide with
        the projected galaxy symmetry axis.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    align: {'cyl', 'sph'}, optional.
        Assumed alignment for the velocity ellipsoid during the solution of
        the Jeans equations.

        - ``align='cyl'`` assumes a cylindrically-aligned velocity ellipsoid
          using the solution of `Cappellari (2008)`_

        - ``align='sph'`` assumes a spherically-aligned velocity ellipsoid
          using the solution of `Cappellari (2020)`_

    analytic_los: bool, optional
        This is ``True`` (default) if the line-of-sight integral is performed
        analytically and ``False`` if it is done via numerical quadrature.

        An analytic integral is only possible with ``align='cyl'`` and only for
        the second velocity moments. For this reason, when comparing the two
        second-moment solutions with ``align='cyl'`` and ``align='sph'``, it
        may be preferable to set ``analytic_los=False`` to ensure that
        numerical interpolation error is exactly the same in both cases.

        When ``align='sph'``, or when the user requests a first velocity
        moment, this keyword is automatically set to ``False``.
    beta: array_like with shape (n,) or (4,)
        Radial anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer MGE Gaussians
        (Default: ``beta=np.zeros(n)``)::

            beta = 1 - (sigma_th/sigma_r)^2  # with align='sph'
            beta = 1 - (sigma_z/sigma_R)^2   # with align='cyl'

        When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

            beta = [r_a, beta_0, beta_inf, alpha]

        and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
        function of the logarithmic spherical radius (with ``align='sph'``) or
        of the logarithmic distance from the equatorial plane (with ``align='cyl'``)::

            beta(r) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]    # with align='sph'
            beta(z) = beta_0 + (beta_inf - beta_0)/[1 + (z_a/|z|)^alpha]  # with align='cyl'

        Here ``beta_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``beta_inf`` is
        the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy transition
        radius (in arcsec like ``sigma_lum``), with ``alpha`` controlling the
        sharpness of the transition. 
        In the special case ``beta_0 = 0, beta_inf = 1, alpha = 2`` the
        anisotropy variation reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but the
        extra parameters allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles. See
        details and an application in `Simon, Cappellari & Hartke (2024)
        <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527.2341S>`_.
    data: array_like with shape (p,), optional
        observed first or second velocity moment used to fit the model.

        EXAMPLE: In the common case where one has only line-of-sight velocities
        the second moment is given by::

            Vrms = np.sqrt(velBin**2 + sigBin**2)

        at the coordinates positions given by the vectors ``xbin`` and ``ybin``.

        If ``data`` is set and ``ml`` is negative or ``None``, then the model
        is fitted to the data, otherwise, the adopted ``ml`` is used and just
        the ``chi**2`` is returned.
    epsrel: float, optional
        Relative error requested for the numerical computation of the intrinsic
        moments (before line-of-sight quadrature). (Default: ``epsrel=1e-2``)
    errors: array_like with shape (p,), optional
        1sigma uncertainty associated with the ``data`` measurements.

        EXAMPLE: In the case where the data are given by the
        ``Vrms = np.sqrt(velBin**2 + sigBin**2)``, from the error propagation::

            errors = np.sqrt((dVel*velBin)**2 + (dSig*sigBin)**2)/Vrms,

        where ``velBin`` and ``sigBin`` are the velocity and dispersion in each
        bin and ``dVel`` and ``dSig`` are the corresponding 1sigma uncertainties.
        (Default: constant ``errors = 0.05*np.median(data)``)
    flux_obs: array_like with shape (p,), optional
        Optional mean surface brightness of each bin for plotting.
    gamma: array_like with shape (n,)
        tangential anisotropy of the individual kinematic-tracer MGE Gaussians
        (Default: ``gamma=np.zeros(n)``)::

            gamma = 1 - (sigma_phi/sigma_r)^2  # with align='sph'
            gamma = 1 - (sigma_phi/sigma_R)^2  # with align='cyl'

        When ``logistic=True`` the procedure assumes::

            gamma = [r_a, gamma_0, gamma_inf, alpha]

        and the anisotropy of the whole JAM model varies as a logistic
        function of the logarithmic spherical radius (with ``align='sph'``) or
        of the logarithmic distance from the equatorial plane (with ``align='cyl'``)::

            gamma(r) = gamma_0 + (gamma_inf - gamma_0)/[1 + (r_a/r)^alpha]    # with align='sph'
            gamma(z) = gamma_0 + (gamma_inf - gamma_0)/[1 + (z_a/|z|)^alpha]  # with align='cyl'

        Here ``gamma_0`` represents the anisotropy at ``r = 0``, ``gamma_inf``
        is the anisotropy at ``r = inf`` and ``r_a`` is the anisotropy
        transition radius (in arcsec like ``sigma_lum``), with ``alpha``
        controlling the sharpness of the transition. In the special case
        ``gamma_0 = 0, gamma_inf = 1, alpha = 2`` the anisotropy variation
        reduces to the form by Osipkov & Merritt, but the extra parameters
        allow for much more realistic anisotropy profiles.

        IMPORTANT: ``gamma`` only affects the projected first velocity moments.
        The projected second moments are rigorously independent of ``gamma``.
    goodbins: array_like with shape (p,)
        Boolean vector with values ``True`` for the bins/spaxels which have to
        be included in the fit (if requested) and in the ``chi**2`` calculation.
        (Default: fit all bins).
    interp: bool, optional
        This keyword is for advanced use only! Set ``interp=False`` to force 
        no-interpolation on the sky plane. In this way ``out.vel`` and 
        ``out.vel2`` contain all the first and second velocity moments at the 
        input coordinates ``(xbin, ybin)``, without PSF convolution.
        By default ``interp=True`` and one should generally not change this.

        IMPORTANT: If ``sigmapsf=0`` or ``pixsize=0`` or ``interp=False`` then
        PSF convolution is not performed.

        This keyword is mainly useful for testing against analytic results or
        to compute all moments, including proper motions,  simultaneously.
    kappa: float, optional
        When ``kappa=None`` (default) the first velocity moments are scaled in
        such a way that the projected angular momentum of the data and model is
        the same [equation 52 of `Cappellari (2008)`_].
        When ``kappa=1`` the model first velocity moments are output without
        any scaling.
    logistic: bool, optional
        When ``logistic=True``, JAM interprets the anisotropy parameters
        ``beta`` and ``gamma`` as defining a 4-parameters logistic function.
        See the documentation of the anisotropy keywords for details.
        (Default ``logistic=False``)
    ml: float, optional
        Mass-to-light ratio (M/L) to multiply the values given by ``surf_pot``.
        Setting this keyword is completely equivalent to multiplying the
        output ``model`` by ``np.sqrt(M/L)`` after the fit. This implies that
        the BH mass is also scaled and becomes ``mbh*ml``.

        If ``ml=None`` (default) the M/L is fitted from the data and the
        best-fitting M/L is returned in output. The BH mass of the model is
        also scaled and becomes ``mbh*ml``.
    moment: {'x', 'y', 'z', 'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xy', 'xz', 'yz'}, optional
        String specifying the component of the velocity first or second moments
        requested by the user in output. All values ar in ``km/s``.

        - ``moment='x'`` gives the first moment ``<V_x'>`` of the proper motion
          in the direction orthogonal to the projected symmetry axis.

        - ``moment='y'`` gives the first moment ``<V_y'>`` of the proper motion
          in the direction parallel to the projected symmetry axis.

        - ``moment='z'`` gives the first moment ``Vlos = <V_z'>`` of the
          line-of-sight velocity.

        - ``moment='xx'`` gives ``sqrt<V_x'^2>`` of the component of the proper
          motion dispersion tensor in the direction orthogonal to the projected
          symmetry axis.

        - ``moment='yy'`` gives ``sqrt<V_y'^2>`` of the component of the proper
          motion dispersion tensor in the direction parallel to the projected
          symmetry axis.

        - ``moment='zz'`` (default) gives the usual line-of-sight
          ``Vrms = sqrt<V_z'^2>``.

        - ``moment='xy'`` gives the mixed component ``<V_x'V_y'>`` of the proper
          motion dispersion tensor.

        - ``moment='xz'`` gives the mixed component ``<V_x'V_z'>`` of the proper
          motion dispersion tensor.

        - ``moment='yz'`` gives the mixed component ``<V_y'V_z'>`` of the proper
          motion dispersion tensor.
    nang: int, optional
        The number of linearly-spaced intervals in the eccentric anomaly at
        which the model is evaluated before interpolation and PSF convolution.
        (default: ``nang=10``)
    nlos: int (optional)
        Number of values used for the numerical line-of-sight quadrature.
        (default ``nlos=1500``)
    nodots: bool, optional
        Set to ``True`` to hide the dots indicating the centers of the bins in
        the linearly-interpolated two-dimensional map (default ``False``).
    normpsf: array_like with shape (q,)
        fraction of the total PSF flux contained in the circular Gaussians
        describing the PSF of the kinematic observations.
        The PSF will be used for seeing convolution of the model kinematics.
        It has to be ``np.sum(normpsf) = 1``.
    nrad: int, optional
        The number of logarithmically spaced radial positions at which the
        model is evaluated before interpolation and PSF convolution. One may
        want to increase this value if the model has to be evaluated over many
        orders of magnitude in radius (default: ``nrad=20``).
    pixang: float, optional
        Angle between the observed spaxels and the galaxy major axis X.
        This angle only rotates the spaxels around their centers, *not* the
        whole coordinate system ``(xbin, ybin)``, which must be rotated
        independently by the user before calling ``jam.axi.proj``. 
        Using the keyword is generally unnecessary.
    pixsize: float, optional
        Size in arcseconds of the (square) spatial elements at which the
        kinematics is obtained. This may correspond to the side of the spaxel
        or lenslets of an integral-field spectrograph. This size is used to
        compute the kernel for the seeing and aperture convolution.

        IMPORTANT: If ``sigmapsf=0`` or ``pixsize=0`` or ``interp=False`` then
        PSF convolution is not performed.
    plot: bool
        When ``data is not None`` setting this keyword produces a plot with the
        data/model comparison at the end of the calculation.
    quiet: bool
        Set this keyword to avoid printing values on the console.
    rbh: float, optional
        This keyword is ignored unless ``align='cyl'`` and ``analytic_los=True``.
        In all other cases JAM assume a point-like central black hole.
        This scalar gives the sigma in arcsec of the Gaussian approximating the
        central black hole of mass MBH [See Section 3.1.2 of `Cappellari (2008)`_]
        The gravitational potential is indistinguishable from a point source
        for ``radii > 2*rbh``, so the default ``rbh=0.01`` arcsec is appropriate
        in most current situations.

        When using different units as input, e.g. pc instead of arcsec, one
        should check that ``rbh`` is not too many order of magnitude smaller
        than the spatial resolution of the data.
    sigmapsf: array_like with shape (q,)
        dispersion in arcseconds of the circular Gaussians describing the PSF
        of the kinematic observations.

        IMPORTANT: If ``sigmapsf=0`` or ``pixsize=0`` or ``interp=False`` then
        PSF convolution is not performed.

        IMPORTANT: PSF convolution is done by creating a 2D image, with pixels
        size given by ``step=np.min(sigmapsf)/4``, and convolving it with the
        PSF + aperture. If the input radii are very large compared to ``step``,
        the 2D image may require a too large amount of memory. If this is the
        case one may compute the model predictions at small radii with a first
        call to ``jam.axi.proj`` with PSF convolution, and the model
        predictions at large radii with a second call to ``jam.axi.proj``
        without PSF convolution.
    step: float, optional
        Spatial step for the model calculation and PSF convolution in arcsec.
        This value is automatically computed by default as
        ``step=np.min(sigmapsf)/4``. It is assumed that when ``sigmapsf`` is
        large, high-resolution calculations are not needed. In some cases,
        however, e.g. to accurately estimate the Vrms inside a large aperture,
        comparable with the PSF size, one may want to override the default
        value to force smaller spatial pixels using this keyword.
    vmax: float, optional
        Maximum value of the ``data`` to plot.
    vmin: float, optional
        Minimum value of the ``data`` to plot.

    Returns
    -------
    Stored as attributes of the ``jam.axi.proj`` class.

    .chi2: float
        Reduced ``chi**2``, namely per degree of freedom,  describing the 
        quality of the fit::

            d, m = (data/errors)[goodbins], (model/errors)[goodbins]
            chi2 = ((d - m)**2).sum()/goodbins.sum()

        When no data are given in input, this is returned as ``np.nan``.
    .flux: array_like with shape (p,)
        PSF-convolved MGE surface brightness of each bin in ``Lsun/pc^2``,
        used to plot the isophotes of the kinematic-tracer on the model results.
    .kappa: float
        Ratio by which the model was scaled to fit the observed velocity
        [defined by equation 52 of `Cappellari (2008)`_]
    .ml: float
        Best fitting M/L by which the mass was scaled to fit the observed moments.
    .model: array_like with shape (p,)
        Model predictions for the selected velocity moments for each input bin
        ``(xbin, ybin)``. This attribute is the main output from the program.

        Any of the six components of the symmetric proper motion dispersion
        tensor ``{'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xy', 'xz', 'yz'}``, or any of the three 
        first velocity moments ``{'x', 'y', 'z'}`` can be returned in output.
        The desired model output is selected using the ``moment`` keyword.
        See the ``moment`` documentation for details.
    .vel: array_like with shape (3, p)
        This attribute generally contains an intermediate result of the
        calculation and should not be used. Instead, the output kinematic
